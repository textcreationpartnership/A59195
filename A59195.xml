            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                     <p>There is a common unity in them both, as well ≈øimilar as di≈ø≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milar and organick: for not onely the whole body, but every part thereof, whether ≈øimilar or organick, ought to be whole and entire.

<note place="margin">What a Tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is.</note> and fir≈øt, for what belongs to the con≈øtitution of ≈øimilar parts, as they are ≈øuch, that is a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perament, which is a quality ari≈øen from the mutual action and pa≈ø≈øion of primary qualities, and re≈øulting out of them ≈øepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and joyned together.

                     <p>But from the Temperament,
<note place="margin">A Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rament of a mixt body two-fold.</note> things are ≈øaid to be temperate or intemperate; and indeed, any thing is ≈øaid to be temperate two wayes, either ≈øimply and ab≈øolutely, and in its own kind, or in relation to ≈øome other; for if there be that proportion of qualities, that they wholly concur in equal ≈øtrength, ≈øuch a Temperament is ≈øaid to be ≈øimply and ab≈øolutely ≈øuch, and ≈øuch a Temperament is commonly called a Temperament <hi>ad pondus,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">To weight.</note> or according to weight, (as if it were weighed in a ballance) and is of an Arithmetical pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion; But if there be a certain inequality of qualities in relation to their ≈øtrength,
<note place="margin">To Justice.</note> it is called a Temperament to Ju≈øtice, and this is called a Geometrical proportion; although, if you ≈øtrictly regard the proportion of the qualities among≈øt them≈øelves, it is then an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperament, not a Temperament.</p>
                     <p>Now this Temperament (as we call it) wherein there is not an equality of primary qualities, takes its denomination from that quality, which doth exceed the re≈øt, whether it be one or two.

                     <p>Of the≈øe Temperaments ≈øome are ≈øimple,
<note place="margin">Temper te to Ju≈øtice two-≈øold.

<pb n="7" facs="tcp:36866:13"/>wherein drowth dryes up moi≈øture, the heat and cold as before being equal.</p>
                     <p>But when two qualities exceed their contraries there ari≈øeth a compound Temperament:
<note place="margin">Compound. The latitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de of Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perament.</note> whereof there are likewi≈øe four kinds ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the combinations, (as far as po≈ø≈øibly they may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bine) of the four primary qualities: to wit, Hot and Moi≈øt, Hot and Dry, Cold and Moi≈øt, Cold and Dry. In every one of the≈øe there is a great latitude, and in the ≈øimple Temperament ≈øome have more, ≈øome le≈ø≈øe of heat or cold by much then other. In compound Temperaments ≈øome one, ≈øometimes both qualities, exceed the re≈øt in an extraordinary, yet different manner.</p>
                     <p>Any thing is ≈øaid to be Hot, Cold, Moi≈øt, or Dry,
<note place="margin">How many wayes any thing is ≈øaid to be hot, moi≈øt cold, and dry.</note> not only ≈øim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply regard being had to the univer≈øal nature of mixt bodies, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in if you con≈øider a middle ≈øort of body exceeding in neither, and in re≈øpect of this you accompt all others that differ from it Intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate, and from the quality excelling is called, Hot, Cold, Moi≈øt or Dry; but be≈øides this, there is made a compari≈øon to three: Fir≈øt, the compari≈øon is made to the next Genus, or kind in nature, as if in the whole ≈øort of living Creatures, you appoint one living Creature to be temperate, all others in re≈øpect of that, are called intemperate; Secondly, a compari≈øon is made with a middle ≈øort of the ≈øame kind, ≈øo a Boy is ≈øaid to be hot, an old man cold; Thirdly, re≈øpect is had to every individual, that ≈øo this compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to that as being Hotter, is Cold, but compared to a colder is hot.</p>
                     <p>Man, for who≈øe ≈øake the≈øe things of Temperaments are ≈øpoken,
<note place="margin">In man there is a twofold Tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> ≈øince his body is not ≈øimply mixed but organick and living, there is required in him a double Temperament, one of the body, as it is ab≈øolutely and ≈øimply mixt; The other as it is living. This is lo≈øt by death, and is often changed by old age; but that remaineth ≈øometimes in the dead carca≈øs after death; yet at length by putre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction and corruption of that which is mixed tis di≈ø≈øolved. In that al≈øo, according to Heat, Cold, Drowth and Moi≈øture, there is a great diver≈øity of parts. But the matter which is proper to living Creatures in all, is Heat and Moi≈øture.</p>
                     <p>Again the Temperament of a living man is twofold,
<note place="margin">Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rament, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluent.</note> the one Innate, the other Influent. Innate, is that which is imbibed in the living parts of man, &amp; by rea≈øon of the Innate heat is inherent in him from his fir≈øt being. Influent, is that which floweth from the principal parts, and is communicated to the whole body. And that it is not the ≈øame with Innate, is manife≈øt from tho≈øe that fall into a Swoun; when the body becomes extreme cold, and yet the Innate Temperament is not changed. The≈øe three Temperaments though
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:36866:14"/>they may be con≈øidered ≈øeverally: Yet they concur to con≈øtitute one Temperament of a ≈øound man.

<note place="margin">The Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perament of a man, of what ≈øort it is.</note> for common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øense tels us, that Heat in man is predominate over the other qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities; for the Temperature of a man to perform his actions be≈øt is Hot and Moi≈øt, and our lives con≈øi≈øt of Heat and Moi≈øture: on the contrary, coldne≈øs and drine≈øs lead us to death, and by how much ≈øooner a man is cooled and dryed, by ≈øo much ≈øooner he grows old and dyes.</p>

<note place="margin">The diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences of the Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raments of man.</note> that heat and that moi≈øture have their degrees. For if the heat exceed the cold and the moi≈øture the drowth moderately, that Temper is be≈øt and is accompted Temperate. All others differing from this are called either Hot and Moi≈øt, Hot and Dry, Cold and Moi≈øt, or Cold and Dry; although all in general are Hot and Moi≈øt.</p>
                     <p>The≈øe differences of Temperaments are commonly explained by the names of Sanguine,
<note place="margin">Sanguine, Cholerick, Phlegma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy.</note> Cholerick, Phlegmatick and Melancholy Temperaments. The≈øe differences and appellations may be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of, if they are not taken from the diver≈øity of excrementitious humours, in various bodies; but from the variety of blood, which is the nutriment of the body.</p>
                     <p>For tho≈øe who≈øe Blood is temperate,
<note place="margin">Occult qualities.</note> or moderately hot and moi≈øt, are called Sanguines: Tho≈øe who have hotter and dryer blood, and their bodies from thence become hotter and dryer, are called Cholerick Per≈øons: Tho≈øe who have colder and moi≈øter, and their bodies from thence grows colder and moi≈øter, are called Phlegmaticks: Tho≈øe who have cold and dry blood, and their bodies from thence become cold and dry, are Melancholians.</p>
                     <p>But we mu≈øt not re≈øt at the Primary qualities; for there are others more noble and more ab≈øtru≈øe, the cau≈øes of many actions, and of Sympathy, and Antipathy, with other alterations that mu≈øt be granted; although in this humane imbecillity, for the mo≈øt part, they are unknown to us.</p>

<note place="margin">The Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perament of ages.</note> the age which is principally ordained for certain internal changes by heat and moi≈øture. Authors for the mo≈øt part divide mans life into three ages, Child-hood, Manly-age, and Old-age; or Youthful,

                     <p>Concerning the nature and original of the innate ≈øpirit and heat,
<note place="margin">Of the original and nature of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate heat.</note> there is a great controver≈øy among≈øt Phy≈øitians and Philo≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, and 'tis di≈øputable, whether it be Elementary, or of another nature; And although in ≈øuch an ob≈øcure thing, ≈øince very learned men di≈øagree, it be very hard to determine any thing, yet I think theirs to be the more probable opinion, who con≈øent with <hi>Ari≈øtotle</hi> in his ≈øecond Book of Generation of living Creatures, and third Chapter; That Innate heat is not Elementary, nor hath its original from fire or other Elements; nor yet is it of a Heavenly na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but proportionable to the ≈øtability of Stars. For eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ≈øpecifical form requires its peculiar domicil and proper ≈øubject, and the more noble form requires the more noble habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and a more Divine power then Elementary, requires a more noble manfion then a body that is compo≈øed of Elements.</p>
                     <p>Moreover, more noble actions,
<note place="margin">The ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øect of the Innate heat.</note> and Sympathy and Antipathy are in it, which purely from Elements cannot proceed; &amp; again this Innate heat and inborn Spirit, in many Plants is pre≈øerved in winter time, and in the mid≈øt of fro≈øts ≈øafe and ≈øecure; Moreover this Innate heat, and radical moi≈øture is founded in the parts which are fa≈øhioned in the fir≈øt generation of an embryon; but the greate≈øt plenty of it is in the heart, which from thence is called by <hi>Galen,</hi> the fire-fewel of the Innate heat.</p>
                     <p>This inborn heat, is the chiefe≈øt in≈øtrument of the ≈øoul,
<note place="margin">The u≈øe of the Innate heat.</note> by which it perfects, undergoes all the actions of life and what≈øoever healthy thing in us, and profitable in generation, in nutriment, or in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pul≈øion of a di≈øea≈øe, is performed by that. From this benefit and excellency of Innate heat,
<note place="margin">The In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate ≈øoul is not a ≈øoul.</note> ≈øome have taken it and the Soul for the ≈øame thing, and have called it the E≈ø≈øence of the vital faculty; the faculty governing us, the ≈øub≈øtance of the ≈øoul, and the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of all our actions; but ≈øince the Innate heat is neither the

                        </gap>mal faculties may be called Natural;) The Natural faculty by the Philo≈øophers, is called a growing or flouri≈øhing power. All its actions tend to the pre≈øervation of its kind, or el≈øe of the Indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duals of its ≈øpecies. Now to the pre≈øervation of its individuals be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs Nutrition, and Augmentation, to the pre≈øervation of its kind Generation belongs.</p>
                     <p>The nouri≈øhing faculty who≈øe action is called Nutrition,
<note place="margin">Nutri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration.</note> is that which turneth aliment into the ≈øub≈øtance of the body living, and re≈øtores what is taken away, and performs this work during all ones life time.</p>

<note place="margin">Augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</note> that which extendeth the body to its due and ju≈øt bigne≈øs, who≈øe office is mo≈øt performed in our growing age, and is extended till it compleateth and perfecteth its due magnitude.</p>

<note place="margin">Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> that by which man by his kind continues to perpetuity, which by Individuals cannot be done.</p>
                     <p>And the≈øe three faculties being as it were the Princes,
<note place="margin">The ≈øer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, Attra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, Concocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Expul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion.</note> have others as it were their ≈øervants added to them; The Attractive, the Retentive, the Alterative or Dige≈øtive, the Expul≈øive.</p>
                     <p>The Attractive draweth profitable nouri≈øhment to the parts; The Retentive, reteins it ≈øo long there till it be dige≈øted. The Dige≈øtive altereth aliment, changeth it, &amp; renders it fitting for that which is living. The Expul≈øive faculty rejects that as excrementi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, which is dull and unfit to be converted into the ≈øub≈øtance of the body.</p>
                     <pb n="16" facs="tcp:36866:18"/>
                     <p>The Attractive, Retentive, and Expul≈øive faculties perform their actions principally by the benefit of the fibers. Attraction is made by the right fibers placed along the length of a member; Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention by the oblique or flanting fibers; Expul≈øion by tho≈øe that pa≈ø≈øe overthwart; but Dige≈øtion or Concoction are performed by the Heat of the member. But in the other parts of the body, the ≈øame faculties want not the help of the fibers, but perform their operations only by the help of the Innate heat which is in each part.</p>
                     <p>But although aliment in nouri≈øhing be in a capacity to be like to the body yet actually it is unlike at the fir≈øt; and therefore is changed by little and little untill it be rendered like to that into who≈øe ≈øub≈øtance it is to be turned, which is performed by ≈øeveral Concoctions.</p>
                     <p>Concoction is either private,
<note place="margin">One Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction is publick, another pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate.</note> and is appointed onely for nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri≈øhment and u≈øe of the part where it is made; or publick, which is made for the common u≈øe of the whole body. That is made in the ≈øeveral parts: this in the Stomack, Liver, and Spleen. Hence there is commonly accompted three Concoctions nece≈ø≈øary for nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri≈øhment of the body: The fir≈øt is that which is made in the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack, the ≈øecond in the Liver, from which that of the Spleen is not to be excluded; the third in the ≈øeveral parts of the body. There are other actions which pa≈ø≈øe through the Fabrick of the whole bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, ≈øuch as that of the Vital ≈øpirits in the Heart, the Animal in the Brain, and that of milk in the Duggs, the generation of ≈øeed in the Stones, unle≈øs you will refer this to the Generative faculty; not by rea≈øon of the part wherein it is generated, but by rea≈øon of the end for which it was in≈øtituted (namely) publick u≈øe.</p>
                     <p>The fir≈øt Concoction is made in the Stomack,
<note place="margin">The fir≈øt Concoction is made in the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack.</note> which fir≈øt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares Nutriment for the whole body: To which for this rea≈øon, not onely the power of Concoction, but al≈øo a double Appetite is given; Natural, by which it de≈øires nouri≈øhment nece≈ø≈øary for it ≈øelf; Animal, by which it requires nutriment for the whole body.

                     <p>The Memory is that which receiveth and retaineth the ≈øen≈øible Species, which are known by the Phanta≈øie,
<note place="margin">The Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory.</note> and when occa≈øion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth exhibits and brings them forth again.

<note place="margin">Remini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcence.</note> Remini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcence is that which out of the remembrance of one or more things ≈øpoken of, by regre≈ø≈øion comes to remember that, which before could not come readily into the mind.</p>
                     <p>The principle and immediate In≈øtrument of all the internal ≈øen≈øes, and of all principal actions is the brain, which other things ≈øhew, but this e≈øpecially; That if that be hurt the≈øe actions are hurt, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe that in curing the≈øe, the remedies mu≈øt be applyed to the brain.</p>

                     <p>The affections of tho≈øe ≈øen≈øes hitherto explained are ≈øleep and watchfulne≈øs.
<note place="margin">The af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of the ≈øen≈øes are two. Sleep.</note> Sleep is a ce≈ø≈øation of the natural and common≈øen≈øe, &amp; of the external ≈øen≈øes ordained for the health of living Creatures, by detaining of the Animal Spirits in the brain, &amp; hindering them from flowing to the In≈øtruments of ≈øen≈øe and motion. The cau≈øes that bring it to pa≈ø≈øe that the Animal Spirits flying into the brain, are there detained, and are as it were ≈ømitten and cea≈øe, are ≈øeveral, whereof ≈øome perform it by taking them away, as watching, labour and other things in the like nature; or by rendring them le≈ø≈øe moveable and, benumm'd, or as others conceive by penning in, and ≈øtopping their way as vapours a≈øcending after taking of meat and drink, or as it were plea≈øingly and contentedly ≈øtopping, inviting from motion to re≈øt, which ≈øweet melodies, murmuring ≈øtreams, gentle rocking and the like occa≈øion; The end of ≈øleep is the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fre≈øhing and ≈øtrengthning of the Spirits and external ≈øen≈øes, by taking away their motions and operations, and from hence comes a reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of their ≈øtrength and vigour.</p>

                        <p>And fir≈øt for what belongs to a di≈øea≈øe; Although as the name of health is generally attributed to all things that happen to a man ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to nature, ≈øo the name of a di≈øea≈øe is given to all things that befal a man contrary to nature, and tho≈øe are ≈øaid to be morbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick: yet if we may ≈øpeak properly, the≈øe three, a Di≈øea≈øe, the cau≈øe of a Di≈øea≈øe, and Symptomes, as they differ in the thing, ≈øo they may be di≈øcerned by their names al≈øo.</p>
                        <p>But whereas a di≈øea≈øe is conrrary to nature;
<note place="margin">The formal rea≈øon of a di≈øea≈øe.</note> but health is that power of acting which is to be performed according to nature: a di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ea≈øe is an impotency of performing natural actions; and as tho≈øe who are apt to do tho≈øe things which are according to nature, are ≈øaid to be ≈øound; ≈øo tho≈øe are de≈øervedly ≈øaid to be ≈øick, who are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>apt to perform tho≈øe actions.</p>
                        <p>Moreover the Subject of a di≈øea≈øe, as al≈øo of health,

                        <p>The cau≈øe of a Di≈øea≈øe or of impotency to perform actions, is an

                        <p>Hence a Di≈øea≈øe is defined to be an impotency of the living parts of man to perform natural actions, ari≈øing from their con≈øtitution contrary to nature.</p>
                        <p>Although according to <hi>Galen</hi> al≈øo to be ≈øick, is not to be able to operate, and ≈øo this definition is not contrary to the ≈øen≈øe of <hi>Galen:</hi> yet that out of the definition of di≈øea≈øes, differences, and profitable ob≈øervations may the better be drawn, <hi>Galen</hi> retains the ≈øame terms of the definition, but places them otherwi≈øe, and in the ≈øecond Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the differences of Di≈øea≈øes, defining a Di≈øea≈øe ≈øaith; That a con≈øtitution of a vitious function contrary to nature is the cau≈øe thereof, and in his fir≈øt Chapter of the differences of Symptomes calls it a di≈øpo≈øition contrary to nature, by which action is hurt.

                        <p>Fir≈øt therefore,
<note place="margin">Di≈øea≈øes of the ≈øimilar parts.</note> the proper Di≈øea≈øes of the ≈øimilar parts are Di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ea≈øes of Intemperature, when that due proportion of the primary qualities is not ob≈øerved, but when one doth excell the other three, or two overrule the other two, contrary to nature.</p>
                        <p>Moreover there are found in ≈øimilar parts Di≈øea≈øes of hidden qualities, or of the whole ≈øub≈øtance, as they call them; when there is not only in the con≈øtitution of the ≈øimilar parts, a due con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruity of the primary qualities, but a certain di≈øpo≈øition al≈øo of the occult qualities is requi≈øite.</p>

<note place="margin">Di≈øea≈øes of Di≈øtemper.</note> are when that due pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of primary qualities is not ob≈øerved, which ought to be, but either one overcomes the other three, or two the other two. Whence one di≈øtemper is ≈øaid to be ≈øimple, another com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound. Simple is that wherein one quality exceedeth, and this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the number of the four qualities is quadruple, hot, cold, moi≈øt, dry. Compound is that wherein two qualities exceed, and this according to the quadruple mixture of the primary qualities is four-fold, hot and moi≈øt, hot and dry, cold and moi≈øt, and cold and dry. And ≈øo in the whole there are eight Di≈øea≈øes of Intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rature.</p>
                        <p>But the≈øe di≈øtempers are again di≈øtingui≈øhed divers wayes,
<note place="margin">Di≈øtemper without and with matter.</note> which di≈øtinctions neverthele≈ø≈øe produce not new kinds but differences, which are found in many differing in kind. For fir≈øt, one di≈øtemper is with matter, another without matter.

                        <p>Moreover one di≈øtemper is equal, another unequal:
<note place="margin">Equal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</note> equal is that which is a little and equal in all living parts, and affects them all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like,

                        <p>But that we may briefly propound our opinion,
<note place="margin">There are Di≈øea≈øes of hidden qua. lities.

Al≈øo becau≈øe contraries may be cured and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øi≈øted by their contraries: But the whole ≈øub≈øtance, or things acting in Occult qualities cure many Di≈øea≈øes; It nece≈ø≈øarily follows that their are ≈øuch Di≈øea≈øes to which ≈øuch Medicines are oppo≈øed: and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le≈ø≈øe there ≈øhould be certain Occult Di≈øea≈øes, in vain are Medicines
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:36866:27"/>invented which act in the whole ≈øub≈øtance. Thirdly, ≈øince there are actions hindred or hurt which neither can be referred to any Di≈øea≈øe commonly known, nor to any external error, as may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in the plague and other Venemous Di≈øea≈øes, hence we may well conclude that there are other Di≈øea≈øes of Intemperature, from whence the≈øe kind of mi≈øchiefs happen.</p>
                        <p>But which and what tho≈øe Di≈øea≈øes are is likewi≈øe controverted. We ≈øetting a≈øide the opinions of others determine,

<note place="margin">Many di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ea≈øes.</note> which in a different manner affect many and different parts of the body.</p>
                        <p>A di≈øea≈øe which occupieth one part of a body, is either ≈øimple,

                        <p>Tho≈øe are called implicite di≈øea≈øes which afflict divers parts which have one common u≈øe, and action,

<note place="margin">By the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a thing. By con≈øent.</note> di≈øea≈øes ≈øome are by Idiopathy, or E≈ø≈øence, others by ≈øympathy, or con≈øent. A di≈øea≈øe by e≈ø≈øence is that which hath its beginning, from a cau≈øe begotten in that place wherein the di≈øea≈øe is ≈øtirred up.

                        <p>Seventhly, ≈øome di≈øea≈øes are inherent to man from his fir≈øt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, others happen to him after he is begotten. Tho≈øe which come from our fir≈øt beginning,

<note place="margin">Endemiall</note> Endemiall are (as it were) native, and genuine di≈øea≈øes, which often frequent one place, and afflict the inhabitants of one region by rea≈øon of their common and dome≈øtick cau≈øe: ≈øuch is the Scurvy to the inhabitants of the Baltick Seas.</p>

                        <p>In the Eleventh place, ≈øome di≈øea≈øes are called great,
<note place="margin">Great.</note> others ≈ømall. A great di≈øea≈øe is ≈øaid to be ≈øuch, either by its ≈øelf, or by accident. A di≈øea≈øe is ≈øaid to be great by it ≈øelf three wayes; fir≈øt,
<note place="margin">How ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold.</note> in regard of dignity, when it hurteth the organs, and in≈øtruments, that are mo≈øt nece≈ø≈øary for the pre≈øervation of life, and in this ≈øen≈øe, Di≈øea≈øes of Intemperature, among≈øt Di≈øea≈øes are of greate≈øt digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; Next tho≈øe Di≈øea≈øes of ≈øolution of continuity; next to them di≈øea≈øes of compo≈øition: 2. By it ≈øelf a di≈øea≈øe is ≈øaid to be great, in re≈øpect of its going back from its naturall ≈øtate, for by how much the more it recedes from that, by ≈øo much is it the more ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nement: 3. It is ≈øaid to be great in re≈øpect of ill Manners, as when an ill quallity is joyned with it. By accident it is ≈øaid to be great, in re≈øpect of the be≈øt part which it po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øeth, in which regard a di≈øea≈øe which otherwi≈øe was ≈ømall, is ≈øaid to be great, as a wound in the heart, or in the brain, which in mu≈øculous fle≈øh, were not dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous. 2. When it hurts the faculty that governs our body.</p>
                        <p>In the twelfth place from the manner, a di≈øea≈øe is benigne,
<note place="margin">Benigne.</note> or maligne: Benigne is when be≈øides its own nature, no grievous ≈øymptom is joyned. Maligne,
<note place="margin">Maligne.</note> is when it hath wor≈øe ≈øymptomes joyned with it, then the nature of the di≈øea≈øe affords of it ≈øelf, from ≈øome occult qualities.</p>
                        <p>Thirteenthly, in re≈øpect of duration, ≈øome di≈øea≈øes are ≈øhort,
<note place="margin">Short. Long.</note> ≈øome long, which ≈øoon terminate, or continue long, before they come to amend.</p>
                        <p>Fourteenthly, ≈øome are acute, others not acute,
<note place="margin">Acute. Not acute.</note> and all acute di≈øea≈øes are ≈øhort, but all ≈øhort di≈øea≈øes are not acute. That a di≈øea≈øe may be ≈øaid to be acute, tis requi≈øite that it may not onely be terminated in a ≈øhort time, but may have ≈øome grievous ≈øymptoms joyned with it,
<note place="margin">Which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute.</note> that may ≈øpeedily not without danger end it in health or death; For an acute di≈øea≈øe is that which ≈øwiftly with violence, and danger comes to its height. Acute di≈øea≈øes are again

<note place="margin">How ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold.</note> ≈øimply acute, and ≈øuch as degenerate from acute. The very acute terminate by the ≈øeventh day; the ≈øimply acute end by the twentieth day; ≈øuch as degenerate from acute are extended beyond the twentieth, even to the fourtieth day; But all tho≈øe di≈øea≈øes that are extended beyond the fourtieth day, are Diurnall, and Chronicall.</p>
                        <p>Fifteenthly,
<note place="margin">Salutary. Deadly.</note> in regard of the end, ≈øome di≈øea≈øes are ≈øalutary, which terminate with the health of the ≈øick, others mortall, which de≈øtroy the ≈øick; and both either ab≈øolutely, or <hi>≈øecundum quid.</hi> Simply and ab≈øolutely, tho≈øe are Salutary that terminate with the perfect health of the ≈øick; Mortall, are ≈øuch as kill the ≈øick; on the other ≈øide, ≈øalutary and deadly may be ≈øuch, <hi>≈øecundum quid,</hi> when they terminate in health; but not ≈øound and perfect health.</p>
                        <p>Sixteenthly,
<note place="margin">Continual.</note> ≈øome di≈øea≈øes are continuall, which continually afflict, and intermit not, in the whole term of their duration.</p>

                        <p>The times of di≈øea≈øes are two-fold,

                           <p>Moreover there is a common divi≈øion of Symptomes into an action hurt, errours of excretion, and retention, and qualities changed, namely ≈øuch as doe not hinder the actions of our bodies.</p>
                           <p>Actions hurt are of two kinds,
<note place="margin">Manner of actions hurt.</note> the one is ≈øo called when the faculty is hurt; The other by rea≈øon of ≈øome external fault, as is ≈øaid.</p>
                           <p>When the faculty is hurt, the action is ≈øaid to be hurt;
<note place="margin">How many ways are actions hart when the facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is hurt.</note> ≈øince the agent is not right, or ≈øince the in≈øtrument (for the faculties of the mind cannot be hurt) is affected contrary to nature. That the natural con≈øtitution of the part, which is the next in≈øtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the faculty is vitiated, which being ≈øpoyled, the mind cannot perform its actions. Again, ≈øome divide the faculty hurt into the faculty hurt alone by its ≈øelfe, and into certain actions hindred. The faculty hurt by it ≈øelfe they ≈øay is, when the next in≈øtrument which it u≈øeth, in performing whereof that action is ill affected: as for example, when the Bladder doth not expel Urine, by rea≈øon that the Fibers which are u≈øed in expelling, are ill di≈øpo≈øed. Again, to the good con≈øtitution of the in≈øtrument is required not only as above≈øaid, con≈øtitution of the part, as it is mixed, temperatene≈ø≈øe, and innate heat, but ≈øpirits, and influent heat, which being deficient, the faculty cannot rightly perform its actions, as mo≈øt plainly appears in the ≈øen≈øes. But they then ≈øay the faculty is hindered, when the next in≈øtrument of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty is well, yet the faculty is hindered in its action, by ≈øome Organick Di≈øea≈øe; as when the expul≈øive faculty in the Bla<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           <p>On the other ≈øide, if the agent and in≈øtrument are in all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øpects ≈øound, and they be well con≈øtituted;
<note place="margin">Through ≈øome exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal error.</note> yet neverthele≈ø≈øe for ≈øome other cau≈øe, which is without the con≈øtitution of the part, the faculty is fru≈øtrated in acting, and is hindred that it cannot perform its action. The action is ≈øaid to be hindered by ≈øome external error.</p>
                           <p>To external error fir≈øt belongs the patient or object, betwixt which and the agent, there ought to be a proportion; for if
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:36866:44"/>the patient be not fit to receive the operation of the agent, a perfect action is not brought forth. Hitherto belong all the≈øe things by which actions are performed, or without which they cannot be performed, as time, place, and order in ≈øome, and moreover the u≈øe and nece≈ø≈øity of actions.</p>

                           <p>Tho≈øe Symptomes which happen in the fir≈øt &amp; publike conco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, which is in the Stomach, are fir≈øt appetite, and truely fir≈øt when the appetite is dejected,; when a man de≈øires not meat, whereunto belongs al≈øo daily ab≈øtinence from meat.

                           <p>Thirdly, the fault of the retentive faculty, is when the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach cannot retain meat as it ought, or cannot retain it at all, or not long enough, when occa≈øion requires; or offends in all the≈øe: the Stomach doth not rightly retain meat, when it em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braceth it, with panting, or with twitching, or with trembling, or ≈øhaking.

                           <p>Sleep is oppo≈øite to watching, if it be too much, which comes to pa≈ø≈øe when it is natural, but not ab≈øolutely ≈øuch; but lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger either from the repletion of the head by vapours, and exhala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as in drunkenne≈øs, or by the con≈øuming of the heat and ≈øpirits through too much labour.</p>

                           <p>But tho≈øe actions are either aboli≈øhed,

<note place="margin">Thick.</note> a thick Urine is that which contains much mixture of ≈øerous and ≈øalt humidity, or al≈øo of other humors.

Moreover in re≈øpect of the colour, there are accounted ≈øeveral differences, but the principal colours, according to which the Urines differ are ≈øix.
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:36866:82"/>Fir≈øt white; ≈øecondly, pale; thirdly, flame colour; fourthly, yellow; fifthly red; ≈øixthly, black.</p>
                           <p>Fir≈øt to the white Urines belong the aqueous,
<note place="margin">White U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine.</note> which bare the colour of pure water, then tho≈øe which repre≈øent thin wine, or fair water, into which is ca≈øt a little Oker, or Choller, as al≈øo ≈ønowy Urine, which repre≈øents the whitene≈øs of ≈ønow, as al≈øo milkey and light gray, or ≈øuch as repre≈øents the colour of clear horn.</p>
                           <p>The ≈øecond is pale like the colour of Oker,
<note place="margin">Pale.</note> or ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pallid, which is ≈øeen in water tinckted with Oker, but ≈øome call the≈øe Urines ≈øpicious, or the colour of ears of corn,
<note place="margin">Straw colour. Flame co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour.</note> and ≈øub≈øpicious, and compare this colour to the colour which is ≈øeen in chaff that is old, or in ≈øtraw.</p>
                           <p>The third colour is flame colour, ≈øuch as is that of a Citron, and in fire burning clear, which if it be more remi≈øs, 'tis called ≈øubfulgent; <hi>Actuarius</hi> calls the≈øe golden Urines, and ≈øubaureous, becau≈øe they are like gold.</p>
                           <p>Fourthly,
<note place="margin">Yellow.</note> the next and neere≈øt to this fulgent is yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, yet ≈øo differing from it, that this inclines more to white,
<note place="margin">Brighter yellow.</note> that is more ≈øhining and ≈øplendid, or neer to the colour and ≈øplendor of the Stars; that which is not ≈øo deep but clearer, then yellow is called ≈øubflavous; <hi>Actua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> calls the≈øe colours croceous, or ≈øaffron colours, or ≈øubcroceous, ≈øuch as are in waters wherein ≈øaffron, or whilde ≈øaffron flowers are mixed.</p>
                           <p>The fifth colour, or red, whereof <hi>Galen</hi> makes three ≈øorts,
<note place="margin">Red.</note> and places red in the middle, extream red, the highe≈øt, and reddi≈øh the lowe≈øt, and tho≈øe he places in Bole-Almonack, and Vermilion, and red, in Cherries and Apples; others make four differences, and fir≈øt they place the colour that is a mixt red, ≈øuch as is the hair of tho≈øe who are ≈øaid to be red hair'd, which again is di≈øtingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øhed into red, and reddi≈øh; the ≈øecond is Ro≈øie; the third purpurious; the forth ≈øanguineous.</p>
                           <p>To the≈øe <hi>Actuarius</hi> joines a vine coloured Urine,
<note place="margin">Vine co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour.</note> which repre≈øents the colour of a red Urine inclinable to black, to this be addes the colour of dry grapes, like new Wine (out of doubt of red Wine) boiled to the third part,

                           <p>Moreover there is a black Urine,
<note place="margin">Black Urine.</note> under which ≈øome-Phy≈øitians
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:36866:82"/>comprehend more colours, green, yellow, black, and ≈øuch like; although there be innumerable dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences of green plants, yet two here are the chiefe, Leek-colour, which is ≈øeen in the blades of Leeks;
<note place="margin">Eruginous</note> and Eru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginous which is like Verdy-grea≈øe, and yellow, which repre≈øents the colour of red Lead, and therefore called plumbeous.</p>

                           <p>Moreover be≈øides the≈øe there are other differences le≈øs principal, which are taken from other qualities and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum≈øtances; fir≈øt from the ≈ømell, for ≈øome Urines ≈ømell little, others very little, and have that odour which is natural to Urine, others ≈øtink exceedingly, and others ≈ømell plea≈øant.</p>

                           <p>The cau≈øe of a thin Vrine which hath little of that ≈øerous ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crement mixt with it, is debility of concoction, e≈øpecially in the Liver and Veins, which coldne≈øs of the Stomach may oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca≈øion, but principally ≈øtore of drink, al≈øo a cold di≈øtemper of the Reins.

                           <p>Thick Vrine is made by the mixture of any thick matter which happens when crude humors,
<note place="margin">Thick.</note> which are cumulated in the Veins, are expelled by nature this way, or when any ob≈øtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is opened out of the Spleen, Liver, Reins, and other parts, or an impo≈øthumation is broken, or ulcer, the thick matter is mingled with the Vrine, or if there be ≈øtore of ≈øerous and ≈øalt humors.</p>
                           <p>If the Vrine be made clear and remain ≈øo,
<note place="margin">Clear.</note> and be of good con≈øi≈øtence, it is a token that ≈øuch clearne≈øs proceeds from the natural heat rightly elaborating the matter, for nature elabo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates not only aliment, but excrements al≈øo, as much as it can,
<note place="margin">Thin and clear.</note> and impre≈ø≈øes convenient qualities in them; but if Veine be thin and clear, al≈øo 'tis a token of crudity; neither hath na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture then begun concoction of humors, and if Vrines have any other colour, then ≈øuch wateri≈øh, they obtain it from collerick humors mixt therewith.</p>

<note place="margin">Troubled, which grows clear.</note> and afterwards become thin, that happens becau≈øe the natural heat begins to perform and concoct the matter, and to ≈øtir it, and mingle it, which notwith≈øtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ≈øince it is not exactly mingled, the heat afterwards cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øing, the Heterogeneal parts are ≈øeparated of their own accord, and the thicker re≈øide in the bottome.

<note place="margin">The cau≈øes of a golden colour in Vrine.</note> a golden colour, which agrees to the Vrines of ≈øound men proceeds according to the vulgar opinion from ≈øome portion of yellow choller, or
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:36866:84"/>rather from a ≈øerous and ≈øalt excrement, yet that al≈øo ≈øomething tinctured with choller, which is mixt with the Vrine.</p>
                           <p>A white Water is made,
<note place="margin">Of a whit.</note> either becau≈øe nothing is mingled with it which may colour it, which is properly called aqueous, or becau≈øe ≈øome white body is mixed therewith.</p>
                           <p>The fir≈øt cau≈øe of aqueous Vrine is Crudity and weakne≈øs of the native heat, by rea≈øon whereof this excrement is left,
<note place="margin">Of an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queous.</note> as it were imperfect. Secondly, ob≈øtructions of the pa≈ø≈øages through which the matter u≈øeth to flow to the Vrine. Thirdly, if chol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, and therewith that ≈øalt humor be carried to another place, as happens for the mo≈øt part in acute Fevers, and Phren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øies with them. Fourthly, much drink. Fifthly, heat of the Reins and Liver, which plentifully draw drink to them, but do not concoct it. Sixthly, Gravel in the Reins, or Bladder, too much of that which is ≈øalt, and thick adheres, but the aqueous flows out.</p>
                           <p>Vrines of another kind are made by the mixture of ≈øome white ≈øub≈øtance, whether it be flegm, or quitture, or ≈øeed,
<note place="margin">Of milky</note> and the≈øe Vrines we call milky, yet for the mo≈øt part they are made thick, and afterwards become clear, and the matter ≈øetling in the bottome of what kind it is, may be ea≈øily di≈øcerned.</p>
                           <p>A Vrine is ≈øomewhat pale,
<note place="margin">Of pali≈øh. Of pale.</note> when pale choller in a ≈øufficient quantity, or a little of yellow is mingled with the Urine, but if much pale choller, or yellow in an indifferent quantity be mingled with the Vrine a pale colour ari≈øeth.</p>
                           <p>If yellow be mixed in greater quantity,
<note place="margin">Of yellow.</note> the Vrine becomes yellow, yet ≈øome times other cau≈øes be≈øides internal, external may give a tincture to the Vrine, as Rhubarb, Saffron, the leaves of Senna, and ≈øuch like.</p>
                           <p>A ruddy colour in Vrine is cau≈øed by choller and blood,
<note place="margin">Of blood red.</note> and indeed if the Vrine be coloured with blood it doth not look clear, and is properly called Vrine dyed with blood, and has a colour like water, wherein the fle≈øh of animals newly ≈ølain have been wa≈øhed, and is made either in ≈øome open ve≈ø≈øel for what cau≈øe ≈øoever, or by the weakne≈øs of the Liver and Reins, by rea≈øon whereof they cannot contain blood and a≈ø≈øimulate it to them≈øelves, or becau≈øe nature at ≈øet times evacuates the blood a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounding in the whole body with Vrine; but the blood which is mingled with the Vrine, is either thin, and the Vrine is made red or reddi≈øh, or thick, which if much be mingled, the Vrine is made exceeding red, but if little either ≈øimply red, or of a pale red, but that Vrine which is coloured by ≈øtore of choller, the choller colouring it and and making it redder, it
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:36866:85"/>≈øhineth, and is as it were like flame, ≈øometimes al≈øo it is made red and thick by plentiful mixture of adu≈øt choller, like wine of a blacki≈øh, or deep red.</p>
                           <p>Wine like Vrine is made by the mixture of ceruleous choller,
<note place="margin">Of Vine colour. Of grape colour.</note> or repre≈øenting the colour of Woad, as al≈øo by the mixture of plenty of red choller: Grapy by the mixture of yellow choller exceedingly dryed, and as it were changed into a Violet colour and degenerating towards black.</p>
                           <p>A green Vrine is cau≈øed by plenty of Aeruginous,
<note place="margin">Of green.</note> and Leck-like colour.</p>
                           <p>Yellow and black Vrine are ≈øometimes cau≈øed by the mixture of external things;
<note place="margin">Of yellow and black.</note> as for what belongs to the internal cau≈øes, the Vrine is made black when either the melancholy humour is evacuated with it, which happens in tho≈øe which cumulate melancholy humours in the Spleen, or black choller is mixed with the Urine, or when the heat and ≈øpirits are extingui≈øhed in the veins, the blood is corrupted and becomes black.</p>

                           <p>Fir≈øt the time in making water is to be ob≈øerved, tho≈øe V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rines which are made pre≈øently after eating and drinking,
<note place="margin">When V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine is to be received.</note> ≈øig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie nothing certainly, e≈øpecially if much drink be taken, ≈øince the decoction is not performed, Vrine is rather to be lookt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on after a perfect concoction, and about the morning. In Fevers regard is to be had of the fits, becau≈øe in time of the Paroxi≈øm the morbifique matter is expelled another way.</p>
                           <p>Secondly, it is to be weighed whether any meat, drink, or medicine, be taken which may change the Vrine.</p>
                           <p>Thirdly,
<note place="margin">The whole Vrine to be taken. It ≈øhould fir≈øt ≈øettle. In what place ≈øhould be kept. In≈øpection of troubled Vrines.</note> the whole Urine made at once is to be be taken, not to be mingled with waters made at ≈øeveral times.</p>
                           <p>Fourthly, judgment is not to be given of Urine before it hath ≈øetled, and the Contents enjoy their proper place.</p>
                           <p>Fifthly, you mu≈øt beware lea≈øt the Urine by cold air, or winds e≈øpecially in an open ve≈ø≈øel, being expo≈øed thereunto, ≈øhould be changed, or corrupted, yet it may be changed no le≈øs by too much heat then by too much cold.</p>
                           <p>Sixthly if the Urines are troubled they are to be ≈øetled by the heat of fire, or rather warm water, that they may return to their former ≈øtate; yet it is convenient to look upon troubled Urines before they become clear again, ≈øince often times in troubled Vrines the ≈øub≈øtance of the Vrine is more manife≈øt then in clear, and often times Vrines which be not troubled ≈øeem to be alike, when troubled they differ exceedingly; and in troubled Vrines oftentimes that matter of the Vrine ≈øhews it ≈øelf, which ≈øcarce any one could believe had been contained in it when 'twas clear.</p>
                           <p>Seventhly the Vrinal in In≈øpection ought to be quiet, and not to be ≈øtirred, only after In≈øpection it may be lawful to ≈øtir the contents.</p>
                           <p>Eighthly, the Gla≈øs wherein the Vrine is to be viewed ought to be clear, per≈øpicuous and void of all colour.</p>

                           <p>Ninthly, the Urine is to be ca≈øt neither in a place too ≈øhady nor too light, yet the colours in a ≈ømall ≈øhade, ≈øo not too dark, may be di≈øcerned be≈øt, but the Contents in a lighter place.</p>

                           <p>Equality and inequality is either ≈øimply and ab≈øolutely ≈øuch; or <hi>Secundum quid,</hi>

                           <p>Ab≈øolutely and ≈øimply, a Pul≈øe is ≈øaid to be equall which neither changed in magnitude nor in ≈øwiftne≈øs, nor in fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quency nor in vehemency, nor in ≈øwiftne≈øs, and if equali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty be ob≈øerved in neither of the≈øe, it is called a Pul≈øe ab≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely and ≈øimply unequall; but if a Pul≈øe keeps not equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity in all the≈øe, neither is made unequall in all the≈øe; it is ≈øaid according to ≈øomething, and in ≈øome re≈øpect to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equall, the denomination is to be taken from that wherein it ob≈øerves not equality.</p>
                           <p>Moreover the≈øe unequalities againe are divided into ≈øy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtematicall or collective,

                           <p>We call an unequal Pul≈øe equally <hi>Myouron,</hi>
                              <note place="margin">Myoures.</note> from the ≈øimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude of the tayle of a Mou≈øe, which as the taile of a Mou≈øe from ≈øome thickne≈øs by little and little and equally tends to ≈øharpne≈øs, ≈øo the≈øe Pul≈øes in magnitude are le≈ø≈øened by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees and equally, and the following ≈øtroake is alwayes le≈øs then the former, which ≈øome call maimed Pul≈øes.</p>
                           <p>The≈øe againe are either deficient <hi>Myourn</hi> which perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally are le≈ø≈øoned till at length they plainly cea≈øe to ≈øtrike a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more; or ≈øuch as at length cea≈øe to be le≈øned,

                           <p>Unequally, unequall Pul≈øes al≈øo are various according to all the ≈øimple differences of Pul≈øes, but the chief, and tho≈øe which the Ancients gave names unto, are the intermittent, deficient, the intercedent, or intercurrent.</p>
                           <p>The name of intermittent is attributed to that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equality which is in pravity and rarity,
<note place="margin">Intermit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.</note> or only rarity, namely when the arterie is ≈øo hindered in ce≈ø≈øation, that one pul≈øation ≈øeems to have two or three, between two which ≈øeeme to be deficient, and after one or more ≈øtroakes,
<note place="margin">Intercur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent.</note> the intermittent begins to beat againe.</p>
                           <p>Intercurrent, or ≈øuch as go between, are oppo≈øite to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittent, and among≈øt them after certain ≈øtroakes, one or more ≈øtroakes intervene, which cau≈øeth inequality of fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quency.</p>
                           <p>A deficient Pul≈øe is when an artery after it hath made un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equall ≈øtroakes,
<note place="margin">Deficient.</note> plainly ≈øeemes to be defective in motion and to cea≈øe; which if it returne to its former motion, it is called a reciprocall deficiency,
<note place="margin">Reciprocall defictent.</note> and this is the difference between an intermitting and deficient Pul≈øe, that a deficient reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procall after a long ≈øpace between, whereby the man ≈øeemes to be de≈øtitute of a Pul≈øe, returnes, but an intermit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting at the highe≈øt returns after intermi≈ø≈øion of five Pul≈øes.</p>
                           <p>A ≈øingular inequality is either in one part of an artery,
<note place="margin">A ≈øingular nequallity.</note> or under one finger, or more, or all; inequality under one finger is, when in dilatation and contraction a certaine diver≈øity in celerity is ob≈øerved, ≈øo that one part of one motion is ≈øwif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, another part is found ≈ølower, and this inequallity Authors divide into three parts, namely an intermitting Pul≈øe, an uneven Pul≈øe, and a ha≈øty Pul≈øe, or ≈øtriking double.</p>
                           <p>Intermitting in one Pul≈øe is when the dilatation of the artery before it can come to its terme and externall re≈øt,
<note place="margin">Intermit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in one Pul≈øe.</note> is interrupted in the middle of its motion, and is refre≈øhed in its re≈øt, yet ≈øo that it cannot remaine in re≈øt but performes motion, and comes to its accu≈øtomed terme and Externall re≈øt.</p>

                           <p>Dicrotus or a double ≈øtriking Pul≈øe is when the Artery be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to be moved, but before it perfects its motion it goes back and a ≈ømall contraction being made it ri≈øeth againe to perfect its motion, and ≈øtrikes the ≈øecond time, ≈øo that a double Pul≈øation ≈øeemes to be made, which neverthele≈ø≈øe con≈øi≈øts of one di≈øtention or dilatation.</p>
                           <p>In equality in one Pul≈øe, but under more parts of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery happens, when in one dilatation the Pul≈øe ≈øtrikes two, three, or foure fingers, but tho≈øe unequally, ≈øo that in one finger the Pul≈øe is otherwi≈øe perceived then in another, and that in a twofold manner, for either the motion is interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, ≈øo that ≈øome fingers perceive motion, others not, or it is a continued motion, when the Artery is otherwi≈øe moved un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der other fingers;
<note place="margin">Myourus on Pul≈øe.</note> and indeed tho≈øe which are made unequall in magnitude in one Pul≈øe are called Myourus, namely when the Pul≈øe under the fore finger is greater, le≈ø≈øe under the ≈øecond, le≈ø≈øe then that under the third, but if the Pul≈øe under the middle fingers be greater, under both extreame fingers le≈ø≈øe, they are called prominent Pul≈øes or Myouroy, changing about unto every part.</p>

                           <p>In a Pul≈øe full of waves there are two inequalities,

                           <p>The Pul≈øes like the moving of a Worme or Pi≈ømire,
<note place="margin">Virmicall.</note> differ from a ≈øurging Pul≈øe only in magnitude, for there is the ≈øame inequality in that Vermicular as in the waving, but the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery is le≈ø≈øe and ≈ølower lifted up, and it renders the Artery as it were into the forme of a creeping worme.</p>

                           <p>A Serrat Pul≈øe is when one part of the Artery is more lif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted up and ≈øtrikes the fingers more,

                        <p>Secondly, in excrements which al≈øo afford ≈øignes, more things are to be con≈øidered, namely the kinds, qualities, manner of ca≈øting them out, quantity, order; the kinds of excrements are two-fold, for either ≈øomething is ca≈øt out of the ≈øub≈øtance of ≈øome part, &amp; ≈øignifies that part to be affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as if a little ≈økin orflake, or little peece of fle≈øh ≈øhould be ca≈øt out of the mouth, it ≈øhews the lungs, the wind-pipe,
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:36866:106"/>the Epiglotis, the gullet or ventricle, to be corroded; and if it be ca≈øt out by a cough, it is a ≈øigne that it comes from the bre≈øt, but if it be ca≈øt out by vomit, it is a ≈øigne it comes from the ≈øtomack; or that it is not the ≈øub≈øtance it ≈øelf, but that which it contained in it, and is familiar to it, that is ≈øo ejected, ≈øo meat, drink, or chile ca≈øt out by rea≈øon of a wound, ≈øhews that the ≈øtomack is proforated, or that the guts are too thin, and if the ≈øtomack be hurt, the ≈øick wil belch much; if the guts, the wind goes out by the ≈øeat; u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine flowing out through an Ulcer or wound, ≈øhews that the bladder, uriters, or reins are hurt; but which of the≈øe parts are affected, the ≈øcituation of the wound di≈øcovers. The dreggs of the belly ejected through a wound, or the ≈ømel of the dung perceived in the wound, ≈øhews that the guts, e≈øpecially the thick, are hurt. So al≈øo of other parts.</p>

                        <p>The quantity al≈øo of excrements afford ≈øignes; if much blood is ca≈øt out, it is a Token of an affect of the lungs; if little, of the wind pipe.</p>

                        <p>Moreover, order in excrements is a token of the place affected; if fir≈øt blood, and afterwards dreggs are ca≈øt out, it ≈øignifies that the fundament, or ≈øome gut is affected within; if fir≈øt dreggs come forth, afterwards blood, it ≈øhews the guts are thin, or the parts above them are affected; ≈øo if quitture which is brought forth in the Urine come before, it ≈øhews

                        <p>IT is exceeding profitable to know the times of di≈øea≈øes,
<note place="margin">Signs of the times of di≈øea≈øes.</note> but e≈øpecially the ≈øtate, but the ≈øignes of times are taken fir≈øt from the form, and Idea, ≈øecondly from the time of the year, and other ≈øuch like things: Thirdly from the comings (or
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:36866:109"/>fits) and circuits, increa≈øing and decrea≈øing. Fourthly, from the Symptomes of di≈øea≈øes, or from the E≈ø≈øence, and Idea, the cau≈øes, and tho≈øe things that precede the di≈øea≈øe, and by the Symptomes, and tho≈øe things that accompany a Di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ea≈øe.</p>
                        <p>As to the form of a Di≈øea≈øe,
<note place="margin">From the Idea of a di≈øea≈øe.</note> by how much the motion of a Di≈øea≈øe is ≈øwifter, by ≈øo much it is nigher to its height, and is a token that the Di≈øea≈øe will be ≈øhorter, but by how much the flower the Di≈øea≈øe is moved, by ≈øo much the more remote it is from the ≈øtate.</p>
                        <p>Secondly,
<note place="margin">Time of the year. Region. Temperant of bodies. In re≈øpect of dyet.</note> that Di≈øea≈øe which happens in the Summer is neerer to its height, that which happens in the Winter is more remote: In hot Regions, Di≈øea≈øes are more acute and ≈øhort, but in cold, longer; tho≈øe that are hotter by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, are ≈øubject to hotter Di≈øea≈øes, and ≈øo ≈øhorter; tho≈øe that are colder, to more cold, and con≈øequently more la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øting; hotter, and dryer Victuals, generate hot humours, and thereby ≈øhorter Di≈øea≈øes; colder, and moi≈øter dyet generates pituitous humours, and ≈øo more la≈øting Di≈øea≈øes; great ≈øtrength of nature in a Di≈øea≈øe that is not mortall,

                        <p>Thirdly,
<note place="margin">From the cour≈øe of fits.</note> in the fits the houre is to be con≈øidered in which the Paroxy≈øme returnes, the time of duration, and the vehemency of Symptomes, for if the fits returne ≈øoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and the latter be longer then the former, and more vehement, it is a token the di≈øea≈øe is increa≈øed: on the contrary, if the latter fits return ≈ølower, and endure a ≈øhorter time, and are not ≈øo violent, it is a ≈øigne the di≈øea≈øe abates; but ≈øometimes Paroxy≈ømes, enveigh equally and all of them return at the ≈øame houre, which mo≈øt commonly is a ≈øign of a long di≈øea≈øe, but ≈øometimes they come not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually, but at ≈øeverall houres, which ≈øhewes that the di≈øea≈øe will be ≈øhorter, and is neerer to the ≈øtate.</p>
                        <p>Moreover, if the fits come ≈øooner, and that equally, the ≈øigns of concoction not appearing, it is the beginning, but if they anticipate more hours then before, it is in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crea≈øe; when they ob≈øerve equality again a good while, it is the ≈øtate; when la≈øtly the omitting or abating of the fits happens to be various, it is the declination: If the order of

When the fits do equally invade without the ≈øignes of concoction, tis the beginning, but when they anticipate not, tis the aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation; when they ob≈øerve equality, it is the e≈øtate: And la≈øtly when the coming late happens again, tis the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination; but if the order of fits be various, ≈øo that ≈øome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the Paroxy≈ømes invade equally, ≈øometimes anticipate, and ≈øometimes come later; when the fits equally invade without ≈øignes of concoction, the beginning is; when they come too ≈øoon no more, the ≈øtate is; but when they come too late, the declination is.</p>
                        <p>As for the longitude and magnitude of fits,
<note place="margin">In longi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.</note> if the time of intermi≈ø≈øion or declination be ≈øhort, and they are neither plainly intollerable, nor altogether free from Symptomes, it is a ≈øigne of the increa≈øe. On the other ≈øide, if the abating or the intermi≈ø≈øion be long, ea≈øie to be indured, and free from all Symptomes ab≈øent, declination is ≈øhewn.</p>
                        <p>But the mo≈øt certain ≈øignes of the times of di≈øea≈øes, are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge≈øtion and crudity, for when≈øoever a ≈øign of concoction ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears ≈øuddenly, it ≈øhews the di≈øea≈øe will be ≈øhort and termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate in health, but a ≈øigne of crudity ≈øhews the di≈øea≈øe will continue long, or even prove deadly; and if grievous Symptomes grow upon the ≈øick, ≈øo that they come with ≈øignes of concoction, they need to trouble no man, but if they happen without ≈øignes of concoction and with crudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, they portend danger.</p>

                        <p>The event of a di≈øea≈øe is known by comparing the ≈øtrength of nature with the di≈øea≈øe, and by the longitude of a di≈øea≈øe,

                        <p>The ≈øignes of ≈øtrength and weakne≈ø≈øe of nature are ≈øought principally from cau≈øes, and effects:
<note place="margin">Signes of ≈øtrength and debi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</note> the proximate cau≈øe of the ≈øtrength of nature is a natural con≈øtitution of the parts. And this, by how much the neerer it is to the naturall tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rature, con≈øtitution and naturalll unity, by ≈øo much it ≈øignifies the firmer≈øtrength; by how much the more remote, by ≈øo much the weaker. For ≈øtrength of nature principally depends upon a naturall temperament, whereunto belongs age al≈øo and ≈øex; for in men and youths the ≈øtrength is firmer; in women, old men and boyes, weaker. Remote cau≈øes are all tho≈øe things, which by who≈øe intervening the ≈øtrength of a naturall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtitution is increa≈øed, or pre≈øerved, or dimini≈øhed; ≈øuch are tho≈øe things, that are taken in, which are carried about, which happen externally, and that are evacuated, and retain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; for if all the≈øe things have been moderate heretofore, and are moderate, it ≈øhewes ≈øtrength of nature; if immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, imbecility. Among≈øt the effects are fir≈øt, actions, which, by how much the more they are ob≈øerved according to nature, by ≈øo much the more they ≈øignifie health: on the contrary, by how much the more or more noble they are, or by how much the more they are hurt, by ≈øo much the more
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:36866:111"/>they ≈øhew the ≈øtrength to be weakned: Secondly, Excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ≈øignifie nature to be powerfull, when in their ≈øub≈øtance, quantity, and quality they are mo≈øt like to na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall, but they ≈øignifie the contrary, if they are contrary. La≈øtly, qualities changed, by how much the neerer they ≈øhall be to the qualities of ≈øound men, by ≈øo much they ≈øhew the greater ≈øtrength in the di≈øea≈øed; by how much they differ from them, by ≈øo much the more imbecillity.</p>
                        <p>The ≈øtrength of a Di≈øea≈øe is known from things e≈ø≈øen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall,
<note place="margin">Signs of a ≈øtrong di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca≈øe.</note> inhering cau≈øes, and effects, or con≈øequent Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomes.</p>
                        <p>As for what belongs to a con≈øtitution contrary to nature, the difference which follows the form of a Di≈øea≈øe, or the cau≈øes, or the ≈øubject, afford ≈øignes of the event; if the Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ea≈øe be great it indicates danger and death, if little health, and by how much the fewer and more gentle tho≈øe Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomes are that ≈øhew what the di≈øea≈øe is, by ≈øo much the le≈ø≈øe the ≈øtrength of the di≈øea≈øe is ≈øhewn; but by how much the more or greater they are, by ≈øo much the more vehement is the Di≈øea≈øe: but principally malignity ought to be ≈øu≈øpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted alwaies; a di≈øea≈øe al≈øo, by how much the more it re≈øides in a noble part, or may draw in a noble part by con≈øent, by ≈øo much the more dangerous; but that which is in an igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble part is out of danger.</p>
                        <p>The cau≈øes are ≈øuch, as either bring forth a di≈øea≈øe, or di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øitions which have gone before it. or ≈øuch as are helpers and ≈øupporters of a Di≈øea≈øe.</p>
                        <p>The efficients are either Internall or Externall, internall are either ≈øolid bodies, or fluid; Di≈øea≈øes therefore which proceed from ≈øolid matter, as from ≈øtones, gravell, e≈øpecially ≈øuch as is great, for the mo≈øt part are incurable; Di≈øea≈øes which ari≈øe from humours are dangerous, if they offend in the whole ≈øub≈øtance, and are malignant, if they are very purred, if plentifull, endued with mi≈øchievous qualities, and inhere in a noble part, and are crude; tho≈øe which are contrary indicate the Di≈øea≈øe to be le≈øs dangerous: Di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ea≈øes which ari≈øe from blood for the mo≈øt part are whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øome, from yellow and pale choller not very dangerous, from leek coloured choller, and the colour of the Yolk of an Egge, for the mo≈øt part deadly.</p>
                        <pb n="201" facs="tcp:36866:111"/>
                        <p>The Aeruginous for the mo≈øt part all are mortall, as tho≈øe from black. A Di≈øea≈øe al≈øo from an humour perver≈øly thin, is more dangerous then if it be mingled with ≈øome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther more mild.</p>
                        <p>Di≈øea≈øes al≈øo which proceed from many vitious humours mixed together, are more dangerous then tho≈øe that ari≈øe from a ≈øingle humour, regard neverthele≈ø≈øe being had to the nature of the peccant humour.</p>
                        <p>Di≈øea≈øes al≈øo are more dangerous which proceed from a humour cau≈øing a tumour, then from a quiet, ≈øo that it doth not adhere quietly to a noble part. As for the exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall and evident cau≈øes, this is to be noted of them in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, if they trouble the body long and violently, and are withall malignant, and continue long in the body, they ≈øig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie a dangerous Di≈øea≈øe; tho≈øe which are contrary tend more to health, and are le≈ø≈øe dangerous. Of the di≈øpo≈øitions of bodies, <hi>Hippocrates</hi> 2. <hi>Apho.</hi> 34. writes thus.</p>
                        <p>Tho≈øe are le≈ø≈øe dangerou≈øly ≈øick, who≈øe di≈øea≈øe is ≈øutable to nature, or age, or cu≈øtome, or time of the year, then they who≈øe di≈øea≈øes are agreeable to none of the≈øe.</p>
                        <p>Moreover, if Adjuvants,
<note place="margin">Effects and Symptomes.</note> whether they are externall or internall, or from nature, or from art, help, they ≈øignifie a healthy Di≈øea≈øe, and not a dangerous; but hurtfull things, if they hurt not, ≈øhew that nature is well: On the contrary, if tho≈øe things which ought to help, do not help, they ≈øhew that the Di≈øea≈øe is dangerous and deadly.</p>

                        <p>If dryne≈ø≈øe be joyned to the heate, let them avoid the u≈øe of hot and drying things, and therefore let them beware

<note place="margin">Wounds, how ≈øet.</note> for what belongs to the manner of joyning together, wounded parts, without divi≈øion, the lips of the wounds, ≈øince they are di≈øjoyned, are to be brought and joyned together, and when they are brought, being joyned are to be kept together, which may be done too wayes without ≈øolution of continuity, either
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:36866:169"/>by ≈øwathing, or gluing, or a ≈øuture with the Glue, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed as for ≈øwathing that is convenient being made for Wounds according to the length of the member,

                           <p>
                              <hi>Capivaccius</hi> defines the Method of healing to be an art wherein by indications remedies are found out that the lo≈øt health of man may be re≈øtored,
<note place="margin">The Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of healing.</note> for the Method of healing (as al≈øo all Phy≈øick) is a certaine principall effective had bit u≈øing indications as In≈øtruments to find out remedies for the cure of di≈øea≈øes.</p>
                           <p>For the end of the Method of healing is twofold. The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall, or proximate, namely invention of fit helps and
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:36866:177"/>remedies in every di≈øea≈øe, or rather an invention of indica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that ≈øhew what will cure. The externall is a re≈øtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the lo≈øt health, or which is the ≈øame, an extirpation of a di≈øea≈øe.</p>
                           <p>But an indication which the Greeks call <hi>Endixis</hi> is ≈øome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times taken in generall for every ≈øhewing or demon≈øtration,
<note place="margin">Indication what.</note> yet properly and in particular, and as it pertaines to the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of healing, it ≈øignifyes the ≈øhewing of remedies, and tis a perception of what is healthfull in the Indicant, known by cau≈øes, or which is the ≈øame, tis a perception, and compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hen≈øion of that which is helping, or indicated, with an appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hen≈øion of what indicates without experience or any force<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able argument from the cau≈øe to effect.</p>

                           <p>Experience is the remembrance and ob≈øervation which oftentimes is ≈øeen to come to pa≈ø≈øe in the ≈øame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.

                           <p>As for the Indication, that is really a certaine <hi>Enthyme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma,</hi> by the force whereof that is found out which is done, for the con≈øequence is ≈øo manife≈øt that no man can deny it, and indeed by the force of tho≈øe propo≈øitions which are the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of Method, and like Axiomes, and principalls in the Method of healing, and they are the≈øe.</p>
                           <p>Every thing which jndicates ≈øhews the con≈øervation of its ≈øelfe, or the taking of it away.</p>
                           <p>That which is according to nature is to be pre≈øerved, and that which is contrary to nature is to be taken away.</p>
                           <p>Contraries are cured by their contraryes, likes are pre≈øer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by their likes.</p>
                           <p>But there are various differences of Indications,
<note place="margin">Differences of Indica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</note> the fir≈øt and mo≈øt generall is taken from things about which they are conver≈øant, which are according to nature, and preternaturall, and it is becau≈øe an Indication is a perception, and in≈øinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the pre≈øervation of that which is according to the
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:36866:178"/>nature, of the indicant to be performed by its likes, the other is an apprehen≈øion of the taking away of that which is preternaturall, to be performed by the contrary of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicant.</p>
                           <p>Moreover one Indication is genericall,

<note place="margin">Profitable.</note>
                           </p>
                           <p>Thirdly one Indication is profitable, another unprofitable; profitable is that, to which ≈øome matter an≈øwers, or which indicates ≈øuch remedy, the matter whereof may be found out, and primarily,

<note place="margin">Inartifici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all.</note> others inarti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiall; inartificiall is that which may be known by others and to the vulgar, as well as to the arti≈øt, who equally knowes the di≈øea≈øe is to be taken away, and the ≈øtrength to be pre≈øerved, but knowes not a rea≈øon how that may be done,

                           <p>La≈øtly, Permittents are tho≈øe which although they indicate contrary to that which was indicated by another, yet, they are overcome by another, as being more powerfull, ≈øo that they are compelled to ≈øuffer that which the other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øwades.</p>
                           <p>From whence it is manife≈øt that a Phy≈øitian ought to con≈øider not only what one Indicant per≈øwades, but al≈øo what another requires, for if all the Indicants agree, and con≈øpire as it were in one, that is boldly to be performed which is commanded by them, but if there be ≈øome di≈øagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment among≈øt them, tis diligently to be weighed which of them per≈øwades mo≈øt powerfully, and tho≈øe things which di≈ø≈øent among≈øt them≈øelves are to be valued by their ≈øtrength, dignity, and number. If they are equall according

                           <p>From whence it is manife≈øt that if the magnitude of Indicants be even, the vitall indications are allwayes to be preferred before the re≈øt, and the greate≈øt re≈øpect is all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes to be had to the ≈øtrength, but if there be not a parity among≈øt the Indicants, that is rather to be performed which is indicated from that which mo≈øt per≈øwades, yet the re≈øt if it may be are not plainely to be neglected.</p>

                           <p>What the differences of cau≈øes are, is ≈øpoken before in the 2 d. Booke, part the 1.

                           <p>There are two generall benefits in the opening of a veine,
<note place="margin">The u≈øe of opening a veine.</note> to evacuate, blood, and by accident, whil≈øt it draws away the blood, the vehicle of heate, to coole; againe in evacuating it performes two things, for it both takes blood out of the body, and allwayes the cource, and violence of humours in the veines; fir≈øt the way it both takes away the ill blood, and only diminui≈øheth it offending in quantity, but the latter way it can revell, and draw back and derive the blood flowne into a part, and the blood which is flowne in whil≈øt it is yet moveable, can draw it to the parts neere thereunto; ≈øo that the opening of a veine may wholy per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme five things, namely to evacuate corrupt blood, to diminui≈øh blood, to revell, derive, and refrigerate.</p>

                           <p>Secondly, breathing a veine is an excellent remedie to dimini≈øh the blood.

                           <p>Fourthly, the opening of a veine may derive the blood, which newly flowed into the part,

                           <p>But Suppo≈øiters are not always prepared for the ≈øame-u≈øe,

                           <p>Suppo≈øiters irritating the expul≈øive faculty are exhibited, fir≈øt, when the ≈øick is ≈øo weak that he cannot take Cly≈øters; moreover when the Seige clings in the Paunch, there is need of a Suppo≈øiter to be u≈øed before a Cly≈øter, that it may make way for the Cly≈øter. Thirdly, if Cly≈øters injected do

                           <p>There are three ≈øorts of the≈øe Suppo≈øiters,

                           <p>They are prepared in this manner,
<note place="margin">Manner of preparing them.</note> Honey is boiled to ≈øpi≈ø≈øitude, that is, ≈øo long till you can take it up with your fingers; into which other things are ≈øprinkled which are needfull, namely, half a Drachm or a Drachm of common Salt, Salt-<hi>Gemmae</hi> a Scruple, of the gentler purging <hi>Species</hi> a Drachm, of the ≈øtronger half a Scruple, of Juices half a Scruple, (or a Drachm,) of ≈øharp Salts ≈øix Grains, or half a Scruple to an Ounce of Honey.

                           <p>But Cly≈øters are compounded in this manner, there are taken of Roots and Rindes an ounce or two, of Leafs three, four or five handfuls, of Seeds three, four or five Drachms: of Flowers ≈øome Pugils, of Fruits, Pears ten, that is, twenty; to which if a purging Cly≈øter ought to be made, Purgers are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, Agrick, Colloquintida, Seeds of Carthamons, (all which lea≈øt they ≈øhould ≈øtickto the Guts, and offend them, are tied in a Linnen-cloath) the Leafs of Senna; but there is no need of ≈øuch variety always, but oftentimes a few ≈øimples ≈øuffice. All the ≈øimple Medicines are boiled in a ≈øufficient quantity of water; of the Decoction take three, four to fifteen Ounces, according to the age, for infants three Oun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, hence tho≈øe that are a little riper four, five or ≈øix may ≈øuffice; for one that is come to ripene≈øs of years, for the

In the Decoction ≈øtrained tho≈øe things which agree to our pre≈øent purpo≈øe, we di≈ø≈øolve, as Oyls from an Ounce to two or three. When we onely are to emolliate, we put in Oyls onely or Butter, but indeed in greater quantity: tho≈øe which have a purging faculty are then wholly to be omitted, le≈øt by rea≈øon of the hard ordure ≈øticking in the Guts, nature ≈øhould be ≈øtimulated in vain, and humours be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing drawn greater evils do en≈øue. On the contrary, when you are to purge, to repell, and a ≈øharp Cly≈øter is required, the Oyls whereby the force of ≈øharp and purging things is re≈øi≈øt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, are to be omitted, and purging Electuaries are to be added for the mo≈øt part double the weight, which at other times they u≈øe to be taken in at the mouth, or Pills are to be di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øolved, Salt al≈øo is to be added from a Scruple to a Drachm; al≈øo Ab≈øtergents, as Honey of Ro≈øes, or Sugar, in weight an Ounce or an Ounce and half; all of them being mixt, and moderately heated by a convenient and known in≈øtrument, they are to be injected into the Paunch an hour or two be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore meat.</p>

<pb n="483" facs="tcp:36866:242"/>Gums, Pitch, Turpentine and Wax, and ≈øometimes Lard, Marrow, and Mu≈øcellages are added.</p>
                           <p>But the proportion of the things that are mixt is various, neither can it ea≈øily be defined and comprehended by Rules, and the quantity of Wax to be mixed is left for the mo≈øt part to the di≈øcretion of the Apothecary, who a≈øcends by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, according to progre≈øs from a le≈ø≈øer quantity to a greater; yet for the mo≈øt part the analogy of mixture u≈øeth to be de≈øired, ≈øo that when they con≈øi≈øt of Oyl, Wax, and Ro≈øin, one part of Oyl is taken, half ≈øo much of Ro≈øin, of Wax the third part: But when Pouders are added, the proportion of Oyles to Pouders is eight-fold, to Wax, two three, four or ≈øix-fold; and to Ro≈øin, that it may ≈øtick the fa≈øter, they u≈øe to add twelvefold; a Cerot becomes the harder three ways, namely, by defect of Oyl and Grea≈øe, by boiling, and ≈øtore of Pitch, Wax, or Pouders.</p>

                  <p>WOnder not Reader, that you ≈øee the≈øe Rarities in the Engli≈øh Tongue, written by the learned Profe≈ø≈øor of Phy≈øick, D. <hi>Sennertus;</hi> neither be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry that the My≈øteries of this Noble Art are laid open for the unlearned to peru≈øe, for ≈øuch I de≈øign them. The antient Greeks as <hi>Hippocrates, Galen,</hi> &amp;c. and the Arabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, as <hi>Avicen, Averoes, Me≈øue, Serapio,</hi> &amp;c. wrote all in their own genuine lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, as <hi>Cel≈øus, Serenus,</hi> and other La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines al≈øo in their vernacular and mother Tongue.</p>
                  <p>The Author teacheth the knowledge of tho≈øe di≈øea≈øes that reigne among≈øt us, and the cure of all ≈øorts of Fevers, continued and intermittent (which are called Agues) he ≈øhews the way to cure the Small Pox, nay the Pe≈øtilence or Plague it ≈øelf, when it is never ≈øo contagious.</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:36866:253"/>
                  <p>Kind Reader, I wi≈øh thee no greater happine≈øs in time of ≈øickne≈øs, then this Book to advi≈øe thee, where an able Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øitian is wanting; I hope it will find acce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptance by thee, and be both welcom and profitable to thee. For my part, as I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect no thanks, nor de≈øire no commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ≈øo I fear no ignominy or calumnia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. May it prove as beneficial to all that read it in this Tongue, as he de≈øires it may that writes it; for ≈øeriou≈øly, he a≈ø≈øures the world, that all true Chri≈øtians Lives are as dear to him as his own; and their health de≈øired mo≈øt candidly by him, that e≈øteemeth and valueth nothing ≈øo much as the publique good of his Brethren.</p>
                  <p>Not long ≈øince, this Authors five Books of <hi>In≈øtitutions of Phy≈øick and Chyrurgerie,</hi> were publi≈øhed in the Engli≈øh Tongue; which incomparable Piece I recommend to thy ≈øerious peru≈øal, as the be≈øt founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for Practi≈øe) that any man hitherto hath laid; Without any further troubling of thee with the≈øe Epi≈øtolary lines, I refer thee to the Book it ≈øelf; and ≈øo Farewel.</p>

                     </head>
                     <p>THat which is called by the Latines a Fever,
<note place="margin">The name. of a Fever</note> by the Greeks (from fire) is called the fiery di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtemper; <hi>Hippocrates</hi> plainly calls it fire, if it be very vehement, as being by the con≈øent of all men a hot di≈øtemper; For although ≈øome Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans call it <hi>Daskalte,</hi> yet that appellation belongs not to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Fever, neither doth it expre≈øs the nature of a Fever, but only ≈øignifieth Cold, An intermitting Fever may be ≈øo called.</p>
                     <p>A Fever is a hot di≈øtemper of the whole body, ati≈øing from heat, kindled contrary to nature in the heart,
<note place="margin">Its defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and nature.</note> and by the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation of the Blood and Spirits, conveyed through the veins and arteries to all the parts, and hindring natural actions, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le≈øs it be prevented.</p>
                     <p>For a Fever is generated, when (as <hi>Galen</hi> 1. Aphor. 14. hath it) The native heat is become fiery;
<note place="margin">Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it.</note> For ≈øeeing that all the parts of the body have a certain temperature, and all of them are actually hot, every one according to its own degree, and thereby are rendered fit to perform natural actions; If
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:36866:255"/>in the heart, from whence the vital heat is diffu≈øed over all the parts of the body, each part receiving its due temper from thence, a certain preter-natural heat be kindled and ≈øpread o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the whole body, ≈øo that to the natural temperature of the parts ≈øome degrees of preter-natural heat are added, and that actual heat ≈øhall be increa≈øed; a certain exce≈øs of heat and a hot di≈øtemper is kindled in the whole body, which is called a Fever. Which di≈øtemper indeed <hi>formaliter,</hi> as ≈øome ≈øay, is contrary to nature, and is called a Fever; but <hi>materialiter</hi> 'tis not altogether contrary to nature, for unle≈øs there had been before ≈øome degrees of natural heat extant, the ≈øuperveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent heat could not con≈øtitute this degree of heat.</p>
                     <p>And indeed a hot di≈øtemper only con≈øtitutes a Fever;
<note place="margin">Drine≈øs is no part of the E≈ø≈øence of a Fever.</note> for although all fevouri≈øh heat tend to drine≈øs, yet that drine≈øs is not ≈øickne≈øs in all Fevers, neither is the body by fevouri≈øh heat rendred unfit to perform its natural actions, it is ≈øo by dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs in every Fever that the natural actions are hindred; but although the fevouri≈øh heat always tend to drine≈øs, yet often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the di≈øpo≈øition of the body wherein that heat acteth, and moi≈øture therewithal, hinders the production of a di≈øea≈øe by drine≈øs.</p>
                     <p>The adequate Subject of a Fever is the whole body,
<note place="margin">The Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.</note> or cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly mo≈øt of its parts, but the principal is the heart, as being that wherein that heat is fir≈øt kindled, and from thence communicated to all the other parts of the body, unle≈øs it be hindred; nor can a Fever be generated, unle≈øs the heart fir≈øt become hot. Indeed the whole body is the Subject of a Fever in regard of the ≈øimiliar parts, and as it is indued with actual heat, which is as it were kindled by the innate and influent heat; For this heat when it is changed and converted into a fiery heat from a temperate and moderate, a Fever is ≈øtirred up.</p>
                     <p>The immediate cau≈øe of a Fever is heat kindled in the heart contrary to nature,
<note place="margin">The proxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate cau≈øe.</note> and diffu≈øed over all the body; For as the heart while≈øt it is well and according to nature, is the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of natural heat, and di≈øper≈øeth the ≈øame over all the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, ≈øo if it grow hot contrary to nature, it di≈øtributes that unnatural heat over all the parts. For although a Fever may be kindled by the inflamation of other parts likewi≈øe, yet that happens not unle≈øs that heat be fir≈øt ≈øent to the heart, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards from thence to all the parts of the body, whence it comes to pa≈øs that in every Fever the Pul≈øe is changed. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthele≈øs every kind of heat in the heart is not ≈øufficient to
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:36866:255"/>cau≈øe a Fever, but ≈øuch a kind of heat it ought to be, as can cau≈øe ≈øuch a hot di≈øea≈øe as can hinder the performance of natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral actions.</p>
                     <p>Whence 'tis manife≈øt that a Fever is one thing,
<note place="margin">A Fever and feve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri≈øh heat differ.</note> and a fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouri≈øh heat another thing. A Fever properly is that hot di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtemper which happens in the living parts of a body, and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders them unable to act; but the fevouri≈øh heat is al≈øo in the humors and ≈øpirits, and ≈øtirrs up that hot di≈øtemper of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, which con≈øtitutes the e≈ø≈øence of a Fever.</p>

                     <p>ALthough there is but one only cau≈øe of a hot di≈øtemper of the whole body, which con≈øtitutes the e≈ø≈øence of a Fever, namely, preter-natural heat kindled in the heart, and thence di≈øtributed over all the body, yet the cau≈øes from whence that heat in the heart ari≈øeth, are ≈øeveral, as <hi>Galen</hi> of the cau≈øes of di≈øea≈øes, cap. 2. and in the fir≈øt book of differences of di≈øea≈øes, cap. 3. recites five, Motion, Putrefaction, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tact of ≈øome hot thing, Cloa≈øure of the pores of the skin, or a Retention of a hot ≈øtream; and la≈øtly Mixture with ≈øome hot thing: And of the≈øe cau≈øes, ≈øome by them≈øelves, and ≈øome by accident ≈øtir up heat.</p>
                     <p>Fir≈øt from Motion,
<note place="margin">Motion.</note> ≈øithence the Spirits and humours of our bodies are hot, from the confluence of them into any part, according to the various motion of the body and mind, heat is increa≈øed, which if it be greater, and be either kindled in the heart, or communicated to the heart, a Fever en≈øueth.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Putrefaction excites heat.
<note place="margin">Putrefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</note> For ≈øince all things that do putrifie become hotter, and out of putred bodies are exalted many hot vapours, thence heat is conveyed to the heart by the veins and arteries, and from thence a Fever rai≈øed.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, contact of a hot thing exciteth a Fever:
<note place="margin">Contact of a hot thing.</note> As if the body wax hot by the Sun, Fire, Bath, or Medicine, and that heat be ≈øent to the heart a Fever followeth.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, if the pores of the skin are clo≈øed, and a hot ≈øtream and hallituous excrements,
<note place="margin">Retention of a hot ≈øteam.</note> which in concoction are genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the body, and u≈øe to be ≈øent out through the pores of the skin, be penn'd in, heat is thereby kindled, and a Fever bred.</p>
                     <p>La≈øtly, when hot things are mingled with humours and ≈øpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, as meat, drink, hot Medicines, all tho≈øe communicate
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:36866:256"/>that heat which they contained in them≈øelves to the Spirits and humours, which if they penetrate the heart, and from thence be di≈øtributed to the other parts of the body, a Fever is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by kindled.</p>
                     <p>And indeed the fourth of the≈øe cau≈øes, or the retention of the hot <hi>effluvium,</hi> is ≈øufficient alone without the re≈øt to cau≈øe a Fever: But the other cau≈øes without this can hardly do it. For although from Motion, Putrefaction, Contact, and Mixture with a hot thing, hot vapours are ≈øtirred up in the body; yet if the body freely ventilate, and that ≈øo much be daily evaporated and emitted of tho≈øe vapours as are generated, a Fever is not ea≈øily occa≈øioned, but when tho≈øe vapours are detained, a Fever is ≈øoon kindled.</p>
                     <p>But although the≈øe cau≈øes if they be powerful,
<note place="margin">Di≈øpo≈øition of a body to a Fever.</note> may rai≈øe a Fever in any body what≈øoever, yet in bodies inclinable an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary power in the cau≈øes may ≈øuffice to beget a Fever. Now they are mo≈øt inclinable to Fevers which abound with much heat, ≈øalt and ≈øharp humours: For which rea≈øon Youths are more apt to Fevers, of which you may read, <hi>Galen</hi> 8 Of the Method of healing, cap. 8. where the whole order of Inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to Fevers are ≈øet down. 1.

                     <p>But tho≈øe are the mo≈øt proper differences which are taken from inherence in the Subject, and the cau≈øe of inhering, which Fevers are divided into <hi>Ephemeraes,</hi> putred and hectick, the true≈øt foundation of which divi≈øion is, that one Fever is in habitude, the other in habit, for although the fevouri≈øh heat in every Fever po≈ø≈øe≈øs the ≈øimilar parts of the body; yet ≈øome are ≈øo inherent in the body, that they require no cau≈øe to che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri≈øh them, and although they are not fed by the kindling of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours and Spirits, neverthele≈øs they will continue, which ≈øort are called Hecticks.

<note place="margin">An Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mera of many days.</note> called <hi>Ephemera,</hi> to which that appellation doth not belong, becau≈øe it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended more dayes: Yet it can be referr'd to no other ≈øort of Fever then this more conveniently; therefore although <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mera</hi> ≈øhould ≈øignifie the e≈ø≈øence of the Fever, <hi>Ephemera</hi> is ≈øo called though with the addition of more dayes.</p>
                     <p>Such Fevers are tho≈øe which no wayes differ from <hi>Ephemeral</hi> Fevers newly de≈øcribed, unle≈øs in durability, the cau≈øe of which is ob≈øtruction of cutanious ve≈ø≈øels, which when they do continue ≈øtopped,

Moreover to the≈øe belong a <hi>Syno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cha</hi> without putrefaction, commonly called a Fever inflative, which is generated from the fervency of Spirits, and thinner blood without putrefaction.</p>
                     <p>The cau≈øe of this Fever is the prohibition of the hot Efflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vium,
<note place="margin">Cau≈øe.</note> ari≈øing from ob≈øtructions or ≈øtriction of the pores of the skin in a plethorick body.</p>
                     <p>This continues ≈øeveral dayes, namely, to the third or fourth day, neither can the plenty of vapours kindled, and exhaleing, which proceed from the blood, be di≈øcu≈ø≈øed in one day, nor can the ob≈øtruction or a≈øtriction of the pores of the skin be ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in one day.</p>
                     <p>The Signs of a <hi>Synocha</hi> without putrefaction are the ≈øame with tho≈øe of other <hi>Ephemeraes,</hi>

                     <p>This Fever as the other Ephemerals is void of danger,

                     <p>But when this Fever ari≈øeth by the inflaming of the thinner

<note place="margin">Cure.</note> the blood offending in quantity is to be abated, the heat to be cooled, and the clo≈øed pores to be opened.</p>
                     <p>Therefore pre≈øently a Cly≈øter being fir≈øt given, or a lenitive medicine, a vein is to be opened, that the blood may be abated, fanned, and cooled, and better governed by nature: And in that more plentifully then in any other Fever you may bleed, yet ≈øo, as that the ≈øtrength may bear it.</p>
                     <p>As for things altering, <hi>Galen</hi> to cool the blood drinks cold water, and commands the ≈øick to drink as much of it as they plea≈øe, which may be permitted in tho≈øe which are accu≈øtomed to ≈ømall drinks, and in whom no danger is to be feared by drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ≈øame, whether by rea≈øon of thick juices which the drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of cold water may hinder the dividing of, or by rea≈øon of ≈øome weakenne≈øs in the bowels, by which they may be offended at the drinking of water: which unle≈øs ≈øeeing in our bodies we ≈øeldom need, we may rather u≈øe other coolers, ≈øuch as are <hi>Oxy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mel</hi> with water, water of <hi>Chicory, Endive,</hi> decoct of barley, juice of Lemmon or Citron, <hi>Oxy≈øauharum,</hi> Spirit of <hi>Vitriol,</hi> and <hi>Salt,</hi> and the like cooling and opening things. And that the appertion may the more happily be performed, you mu≈øt ab≈øtain from ≈øyrrups and con≈øerves with much ≈øugar in them, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le≈øs they are much watered. If ob≈øtruction of the pores of the skin be pre≈øent, 'tis to be opened as I ≈øaid before.</p>

<note place="margin">Whether, when, and why to be done in a putred Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.</note> e≈øpecially when neither age nor want of ≈øtrength prohibites it. And he addeth this rea≈øon; For nature which rules our bodies being enlighthed, and unburthened of that by which as with a pack it was oppre≈ø≈øed, what remains, it will overcome without difficulty, and therefore not being forgetful of its proper office, will both concoct what can be concocted, and ca≈øt out what may be emitted. Yet this precept of <hi>Galen</hi> is to be rightly under≈øtood and explained. For although there are many occa≈øions for opening a vein, and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors cannot agree about the rea≈øon why <hi>Galen</hi> commands Phle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>botomy in putred Fevers: Yet 'tis clear he did it, that by evacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of the blood, nature might be enlightened and freed from the greate≈øt part of her burthen, for when blood abounds, the opening of a vein, and purging of Cacochymy are the be≈øt reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies; furthermore when it is a plethorick body, without doubt we ≈øhould open a vein. In ≈øome mea≈øure the breathing of a vein, doth take away the cacochymy contained in the veins, and mixed with the blood, ≈øince the vein being opened, the vitious humours go out with the blood, e≈øpecially becau≈øe purgation which can take away foul humours out of the veins, is not ≈øo ≈øafe as the breathing of a vein to be appointed at the beginning of a Fever. For although Phlebotomy cannot take away all the ill humours out of the veins, yet nature is le≈ø≈øned ≈øome part of her burthen, and therefore can concoct and ma≈øter the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the more ea≈øily, for it may be that the plenty of blood, which before the ≈øickne≈øs was no trouble to the party, now being ≈øick and weakened with a Fever, may become burthen≈øom unto him. And although ≈øome good blood be emitted therewith, yet that hurts not the ≈øick, but rather helps, as is ≈øaid: As we al≈øo ≈øee by critical Hemorrhodes, that nature ≈øends out no ≈ømall quantity of good blood together. Yet nature for the mo≈øt part u≈øeth to
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:36866:263"/>drive no ≈ømall part of peccant humours to the extream and ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutaneous parts; thence and in the fir≈øt place mo≈øt commonly the wor≈øt blood comes fir≈øt out. Whence it is manife≈øt e≈øpecially in continual Fevers, in tho≈øe who abound with blood, or have peccant humours mixt with their blood, that bleeding is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and that at the beginning, that nature may be unladed of part of her burthen, but if vitious humours are not intermingled with the blood in the greater veins, the breathing of a vein for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vacuation thereof is not to be u≈øed.</p>
                     <p>Cooling and fanning the blood is performed by lerting blood: but they are only to be done when bleeding will not cool it alone.

<note place="margin">Quality.</note> ≈øince it is to be con≈øidered either as it is meat, or as it is medicinal meat, in the former re≈øpect tho≈øe meats are to be cho≈øen that are of ea≈øie≈øt concoction, full of good juyce, facile to be di≈øtributed, and which hath the lea≈øt excrements: But if it be con≈øidered as Medicinal, Fir≈øt, it ought to be contrary to the Fever, and therefore it ≈øhould be cold and moi≈øt, 1. <hi>Aphor.</hi> 16. moreover it ≈øhould be repugnant to the cau≈øes, and all exce≈øs of qualities in them.</p>

<note place="margin">Drink.</note> and by it's cooling it
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:36866:267"/>mitigates the heat, and the drine≈øs is hindred: Yet we are to be careful that nature be not burthened with it, and the concoction of matter hindred by it, and therefore in intermitting Fevers during the Paroxi≈øm, we ≈øhould ab≈øtain from drink as neer as we can: But in continued Fevers, when heat, thir≈øt, and debility of ≈øtrength do require, you may give more drink; but ≈øithence drink is to be con≈øidered, not as drink only, but as medicinal, hence it comes to pa≈øs, that at certain times, certain drinks are to be cho≈øen. Drink con≈øidered as drink, ought to be given ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the rules for meat: But as it is con≈øidered as altering, by how much the dry heat is more inten≈øe, by ≈øo much the more, hotter drinks are to be avoided, and the colder to be cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øen. Yet regard is to be taken of the cau≈øe, and oftentimes there will be need of attenuating and ab≈øterging drinks, and not of cooling only; and the matter being deeper fa≈øtened in the part, admits not cooling drink. The drinking of cold water is only u≈øeful in acute Fevers, 'tis never proper in intermittent. Fair water is often altered with barley, which is called a decoction, and barley-water. In≈øtead of drink, Juleps are al≈øo exhibited, water mixed with Honey, Oxymel, Emul≈øions, Whey, ≈øtrong beer, wine. But ≈øeeing certain drinks for certain Fevers are mo≈øt convenient, we may more properly handle them ≈øeverally among≈øt the different kinds of Fevers, of which ≈øorts are peculiar for ≈øuch a particular Fever then in general to treat thereof.</p>

The former are called fiery <hi>Syno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaes,</hi> and Fevers containing; the other are called <hi>Synoches,</hi> or continued, in≈øtead of a genus.</p>
                     <p>The Fever <hi>Synocha</hi> putred,
<note place="margin">A Puered Synocha.</note> is a Fever, which without any ≈ølacking or increa≈øing afflicteth from the beginning to the end, ari≈øing from putrefaction of the blood in the greater branches of
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:36866:268"/>the vena cava. Although continued Fevers may ari≈øe out of ve≈ø≈øels of determinate parts, yet ≈øuch are Symptomatical: And if they are true Synochaes, which have their original from the default of any part, as from the womb offending: Yet that part only affords an occa≈øion, the polluted, putredity being commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated, that the blood in the greater ve≈ø≈øels might corrupt. But there are Fevers ri≈øen from determinate parts, for the mo≈øt part continued Periodicks.</p>
                     <p>So ≈øometimes peccant matter in the fir≈øt pa≈ø≈øages collected in the fir≈øt concoction, which u≈øeth to go to ≈øome of the humours, which at certain Periods are moved, and hath not as yet received its limits for motion, it u≈øeth then to corrupt the humours, and communicate putrefaction to the vena cava, which Fevers for the mo≈øt part are malignant.</p>
                     <p>A putred <hi>Synocha</hi> hath its original for the mo≈øt part from tran≈øpiration hindred, and want of ventilation of the blood,
<note place="margin">The cau≈øe.</note> and hot fuliginous retentions, by rea≈øon of ob≈øtruction of veins, as well in the skin, as al≈øo in the internal parts. And the blood ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to nouri≈øh the body putrifies in the≈øe <hi>Synochaes,</hi> and putrefying, continually ≈øends hot vapours to the heart. For when preter-natural heat is ≈øo kindled in the veins, that nature can no longer rule it, it becomes putred and is corrupted. Nor is there any need that the putred blood ≈øhould be turned into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther humour pre≈øently. For blood of its own nature is apt to putrefaction, and in inflamations we ≈øee it changed to quitture, not into choller; though nothing hinder it in the veins but that it might: And e≈øpecially the Ichor or thin wate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri≈øh part of the blood is apt to turn to putrefaction, and by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon of the Ichor the blood in the fir≈øt place is corrupted, which happens, when the vapours which ought to tran≈øpire, are retai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the veins. Yet the whole blood doth not putrifie, but ≈øome parts thereof, which ≈øo long as they are not ≈øeperated from the good blood, crudity is ≈øaid to be pre≈øent, which afterwards by concoction are ≈øeperated from the good blood, which being done, Nature appoints evacuation, by which the blood returns to its former purity again.</p>
                     <p>A <hi>Synocha</hi> is three-fold, <hi>Acmastick,</hi> i. e. when it remains al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes in the ≈øame ≈øtate, namely,
<note place="margin">Differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</note> when ≈øo much of the humour daily putrifies as is di≈øcu≈ø≈øed, this is called al≈øo <hi>Homotonos. Epacmastick</hi> or <hi>Anabaticos</hi> is when the heat continually increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øeth, and more of the matter is kindled then can be di≈øcu≈ø≈øed. <hi>Paraema≈øtick</hi> is when there is more di≈øcu≈ø≈øed then corrupted, and thence the heat alwayes decres≈øeth. Furthermore it blood which
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:36866:269"/>putrifies be temperate ab≈øolute, 'tis called a ≈øanguinious <hi>Synoch a</hi> in particular: But if it be hotter, which u≈øeth to be called cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerick, the di≈øea≈øe is then called <hi>Synocha bilo≈øa.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Fever is known fir≈øt by this,
<note place="margin">Diagno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtick ≈øigns.</note> that it continues from the beginning to the end without any exa≈øperation and mutation: Moreover becau≈øe the Pul≈øe is great, vehement, ≈øwift, frequent, unequal and inordinate. And in a <hi>Synocha</hi> proceeding from temperate blood the ≈øigns of Plethory are pre≈øent: The blood to him that toucheth ≈øeems much and full of vapours, and is not ≈øo trouble≈øome and ≈øharp as in other Fevers, and other ≈øignes are pre≈øent which are ob≈øerved in a <hi>Synocha</hi> that is not putred. A putred <hi>Synocha</hi> is di≈øtingui≈øhed from a non-putred by certain ≈øigns. The heat in a putred is ≈øharper then in a non-putred. In a putred the urine is red, thick and troubled, without any ≈øedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and crude, or a little concocted in the beginning; the Pul≈øe affords ≈øignes of putrefaction, and all the Symptomes are greater then in a Fever that is not putred.</p>
                     <p>A <hi>Synochabilo≈øa</hi> happens to tho≈øe that are troubled with cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerick blood, and the heat is ≈øharper then in a <hi>Synocha</hi> proceeding from temperate blood, thir≈øt is more trouble≈øome, the urine thinner and ≈øharper, and other ≈øignes which are u≈øual in cholerick Fevers are di≈øcerned.</p>
                     <p>This Fever is the mo≈øt ≈øimple among≈øt the putred,
<note place="margin">Progno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticks.</note> and ea≈øie≈øt to be cured. And being pure, ≈øeldom pa≈ø≈øeth ≈øeven dayes, but the ≈øpurious is extended to the fourteenth day, and is terminated ≈øooner or later, as the ≈øignes of concoction appear ≈øooner or later. A white urine in a <hi>Synocha</hi> is evil. The lea≈øt dangerous of all is that which is called <hi>Synochos Paracma≈øticos,</hi> next to that <hi>Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma≈øticos:</hi> But that is mo≈øt dangerous which continually increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øeth, and is called <hi>Epacma≈øticos,</hi> which ea≈øily degenerates into a di≈øea≈øe called <hi>Cau≈øus.</hi> And by how much the fewer the evil Symptomes are, by ≈øo much the better hopes; the more they are, the more danger is ≈øhewn.</p>
                     <p>The whole cure con≈øi≈øts in taking away the cau≈øe,
<note place="margin">Indicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.</note> and alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the fevouri≈øh heat. Blood therefore as abounding in plenty is to be le≈ø≈øened, the pores of the skin to be opened, the cau≈øes of ob≈øtructions being taken away. The fevouri≈øh heat is to be tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered and allayed, if there be ≈øtrength, as for the mo≈øt part there is, thin diet is to be u≈øed.</p>
                     <p>Therefore a vein is forthwith to be opened in the right arm, a Cly≈øter or lenitive medicine being given fir≈øt, if occa≈øion require, and to take away as much blood as the ≈øtrength will permit.
<note place="margin">Breathing of a vein.</note> and you may more boldly take away blood in this, then in any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ≈øort of Fever.</p>
                     <pb n="31" facs="tcp:36866:269"/>
                     <p>Blood being evacuated,
<note place="margin">Medicines.</note> that the concoction may be made more facile, we are to u≈øe tho≈øe things which allay the heat, free from ob≈øtructions, and re≈øi≈øt putrefaction; namely, the juice of Sorrel, Lemmons, Citrons, and Syrrups and Con≈øerves prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of them, Syrrup of Sorrel ≈øimple, Oxymel ≈øimple, Oxy≈øau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>harum ≈øimple, Spirit of Vitriol, and the four cold ≈øeeds with cooling waters are to be admini≈øtred.</p>
                     <p>Principally we ought to endeavour that the pores of the skin may be freed from ob≈øtruction, which for the mo≈øt part is the cau≈øe of this di≈øea≈øe, which thing Oxymel and wine mingled with honey, and the honey di≈ø≈øolved, will conveniently perform, ≈øince they are ea≈øily carried to the outmo≈øt parts of the body, and attenuate dull thick humours, and ≈øimple Oxymel re≈øi≈øts putre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction.</p>
                     <p>Concoction being perfected, the Ancients u≈øed to drink cold water, and gave ≈øo much of it to drink, as might not only extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gui≈øh the fevouri≈øh hear, but that the matter concocted might be evacuated by ≈øtool, vomit or ≈øweats. But in our countries, ≈øick people are not ≈øo accu≈øtomed to drink cold water, and many inconveniences are to be feared by the u≈øe thereof. So likewi≈øe ≈øwimming in cold water, which was u≈øual with the Ancients, doth not agree with our bodies.</p>
                     <p>The concoction being perfected, nature u≈øeth for the mo≈øt part critically to evacuate the corrupted matter, which if it be not done, it ought to be performed by the Phy≈øician with purging medicines.</p>
                     <p>Dyet in this Fever ought to be thin,

                     <p>WHereas among≈øt continued Fevers there is often men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion made of a <hi>Cau≈øus,</hi> we are al≈øo here to ≈øay ≈øome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of it: But a <hi>Cau≈øus</hi> is not any difference of a Fever, but rather a mea≈øure expre≈ø≈øing the quality of fevouri≈øh heat. The word <hi>Cau≈øus</hi> is ≈øometimes taken generally, and not ≈øo properly, ≈øometimes <hi>≈øpecialiter,</hi> and more properly: Generally for any ≈øort of Fever who≈øe heat is vehement, in particular for a Fever which hath two Pathognomonicks, great heat, extream and
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:36866:270"/>unextingui≈øhable thir≈øt. A <hi>Cau≈øus</hi> properly and in ≈øpecie ≈øo called, is again twofold, legitimate and ≈øpurious: legitimate is that which hath alwayes, and that evidently, tho≈øe two ≈øignes joyned with it: an illegitimate is that wherein tho≈øe two ≈øignes are not ≈øo evident.</p>
                     <p>Whence it is manife≈øt that burning Fevers,
<note place="margin">Burning Fevers.</note> and ≈øuch as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly and in ≈øpecie are ≈øo called, are continued Fevers, and ari≈øe from choller. And ≈øo a <hi>Cau≈øus</hi> or burning Fever properly ≈øo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, is a Fever continued, Bilions, and indeed either <hi>Synocha bilo≈øa,</hi> which we have newly handled, or a continued tertian, whereof we are to ≈øpeak next.</p>
                     <p>The Pathognomonick ≈øignes as we ≈øaid before, are two, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement and burning heat, and unquenchable thir≈øt, although the ≈øick ≈øhall drink;
<note place="margin">Diagno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øticks.</note> and the more legitimate the <hi>Cau≈øus</hi> is, by ≈øo much the≈øe ≈øignes are greater, yet the thir≈øt is ≈øometimes re≈øi≈øted if a little cough happen, which may draw humors from the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring parts.</p>
                     <p>Concurrent ≈øignes there are many, as a dry tongue, rough, black, watching, giddine≈øs of the brain, difficulty of breathing, thick and great, and the ≈øick continually blow, opening their mouth, that the hot ≈øpirits may the ea≈øier exhale.</p>
                     <p>The≈øe Fevers if they are pure,
<note place="margin">Progno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øticks.</note> never continue long. For na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture cannot long endure ≈øuch burning and vehement heat; and the Symptomes which accompany it with their vehemency. And for the mo≈øt part they are terminated the ≈øeventh day, ≈øome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the ninth, eleventh, fourteenth: but the ≈øpurious are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted longer, and all of them are dangerous according to <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrates</hi> 4. <hi>Aphor.</hi> 43. Fevers of what kind ≈øoever that have no intermi≈ø≈øion by the third day, are the ≈øtronger, and fuller of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. Yet ≈øome are more dangerous then others, according to the violence of the heat, and of the Symptomes, and force of the ≈øtrength, and by how much the greater digre≈ø≈øion is made from the natural ≈øtate, by ≈øo much the more dangerous is the Fever. Hence if an old man be troubled with a burning Fever, which ≈øeldom happens, 'tis deadly, as <hi>Galen</hi> hath it, 1. <hi>Aphor.</hi> 14. They lye down in no le≈øs danger who are exeedingly burnt in cold air: Who if they have not great ≈øtrength, neither the ≈øignes of concoction appear, it can not be that they ≈øhould e≈øcape, as the ≈øame <hi>Galen</hi> 11. <hi>Met. med. cap.</hi> 9. writeth. To whom if vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Symptomes happen, by ≈øo much the more dangerous the di≈øea≈øe ≈øhall be, whether they are Pathognomonick or ≈øuperveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, yet if by the other ≈øignes, it be manife≈øt to be a burning Fever, and that thir≈øt be wanting, this al≈øo is dangerous, for
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:36866:270"/>it ≈øhews the ≈øick either to be in a Delirium, or that the de≈øiring faculty of the ≈øtomack faileth.</p>
                     <p>Black urines are al≈øo evil, as al≈øo thin, crude, and ≈øuch as have other ill tokens in them.</p>
                     <p>But it is good if the ≈øick can ea≈øily endure his ≈øickne≈øs, the Symptomes being not without vehemency, if he can ea≈øily fetch breath; if he complain of pain in no internal part, if he ≈øleep; if he find benefit by his ≈øleep; if the body be equally hot and ≈øoft, if the tongue be not too dry, if the urine be good. But if when the ≈øignes of concoction appear, and that there is much ≈øtrength, in a critical day there happen large Hemorrhodes, or bleeding at the no≈øe, without doubt the ≈øick e≈øcapeth: For it is proper if there be any other of the pure burning Fevers, that they ≈øhould be cured by bleeding. Yet ≈øometimes they are determined by Sweats, loo≈øene≈øs of the belly, vomits, and impo≈øthums. But there are many Progno≈øticks of burning Fevers in <hi>Hippocrates</hi> in <hi>Prognosticis, Porrheticus,</hi> and <hi>Choacis praenotionibus,</hi> and there are many expounded in the In≈øtitutions, lib. 3. part. 3.</p>
                     <p>But by what means burning Fevers are to be cured, appears by what hath been ≈øpoken of a <hi>Synocha bilo≈øa</hi> with putrefaction, and tho≈øe things that ≈øhall be ≈øaid of the cure of the continued Tertian ≈øhall make manife≈øt.</p>

                     <p>ANother kind of continued putred Fevers which they call in particular continued, comprehends tho≈øe Fevers,
<note place="margin">Continus periodick Fevers.</note> which indeed continually remain, and have no remi≈ø≈øion before they are plainly di≈ø≈øolved, yet at certain periods they are exa≈øpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, whence they are called continued periodick and proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated Fevers.</p>
                     <p>But as Fevers containing have their original from the blood appointed for nouri≈øhing the body; ≈øo continued Periodicks,
<note place="margin">their cau≈øes.</note> as al≈øo intermittints proceed from an excrementitious humour and Cacochymie. Therefore continued Periodicks agree in this with Fevers containing, that both their cau≈øes are contained in the vena cava, but with intermittents in this that both proceed from excrementitious humours. But they differ from Fevers contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, in that they proceed from alimentary blood; the≈øe from an excrementitious humour: From intermittent becau≈øe the
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:36866:271"/>matter which is the cau≈øe of continued Periodicks is generated in the ≈øecond concoction, and contained in the vena cava: But that matter which is the cau≈øe of intermitting Fevers is contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the fir≈øt concoction, or certainly in tho≈øe parts which are about the liver, which are not appointed for perfect ≈øanguifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. Namely, the matter of continued Periodick Fevers is generated in the Organs of the ≈øecond concoction, if for any cau≈øe what≈øoever it be not rightly performed. For then the pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant humours generated in the ≈øecond concoction are ≈øent with the blood into the veins, which there ≈øtirreth up the≈øe continued periodick Fevers.</p>
                     <p>Which matter ≈øince it is not only confu≈øed with the blood, as in intermitting Fevers,
<note place="margin">The rea≈øon of its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuity.</note> but from the very fir≈øt original is mixed therewith throughly. Nature al≈øo cannot expell it before con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction, and therefore the Fever from the beginning continually la≈øteth. Yet the≈øe Fevers have exa≈øperations at ≈øet times, becau≈øe that from the in≈øtruments of the ≈øecond concoction, fre≈øh mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which is the cau≈øe of the≈øe periods is afforded, and indeed for the mo≈øt part from the liver: Whence al≈øo continued Terti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans are mo≈øt frequent.</p>
                     <p>The≈øe Fevers are generally known becau≈øe they never come to apurexie,
<note place="margin">Signs.</note> yet at certain periods they are increa≈øed and remitted. Neither doth cold, trembling, nor ≈øhaking fits precede their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>a≈øperation, neither doth ≈øweat follow their remi≈ø≈øion.</p>
                     <p>There are three kinds of the≈øe Fevers.</p>
                     <p>For ≈øome are exa≈øperated each other day,

                     <p>Fir≈øt a tertian continued is a putred Fever,
<note place="margin">A Tertian continued.</note> ari≈øing from blood with ill juyce and choller putrefying in the vena cava, indeed continued, but afflicting mo≈øt the third day.</p>
                     <p>The cau≈øes of this Fever are all things which can increa≈øe ≈øtore of cholerick Cacochymy in the veins,
<note place="margin">The cau≈øe.</note> and being cumulated there of cholerick Cacochymy in the veins, and being cumulated there can introduce putrefaction; ≈øuch as are before propounded.</p>
                     <p>This Fever is thus known,
<note place="margin">Signs.</note> in that it is continued, and the third day it is exa≈øperated. Yet there are pre≈øent other ≈øignes and Symptomes of continued and burning Fevers.</p>
                     <p>But what is to be hoped concerning their event,
<note place="margin">Progno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øticks.</note> is manife≈øt from things which are ≈øpoken of the Progno≈øticks of burning Fevers.</p>
                     <p>Concerning the indications for cure,
<note place="margin">Cure.</note> this Fever if it be pure,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:36866:271"/>≈øince it is exceeding hot and burning, and the cau≈øe thereof hot and dry, it requires extraordinary cooling and moi≈øtening, and indeed more then any other Fever.</p>
                     <p>The humour it ≈øelf indicates evacuation; but crudity for the mo≈øt part forbids it: but if the Fever be ≈øpurious, regard is to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether to be had to the humour which is mixed with choller: if the Symptomes need it they are to be re≈øi≈øted likewi≈øe.</p>
                     <p>Therefore a vein is to be opened ≈øo that the ≈øtrength will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit it, by which means both ≈øome part of the peccant humour may be evacuated,
<note place="margin">Opening a vein.</note> and the blood cooled and revell'd from the more noble parts. And nature her ≈øelf ≈øometimes u≈øeth to make evacuation by the no≈øe in the beginning of the≈øe Fevers, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Fever is wont to be abated; but the vein ≈øhould be ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the cubit forthwith in the beginning, or certainly in the augmentation, and blood is to be taken in ≈øuch plenty as the ≈øtrength of the patient requires.</p>
                     <p>But you are not to appoint purgation unle≈øs the matter be turged.
<note place="margin">Lenitives.</note> Yet 'tis very nece≈ø≈øary that the belly and fir≈øt pa≈ø≈øages be evacuated before a vein be opened, but the medicines which perform that, ought to be cold and moi≈øt not hot; or if they are hot, they ≈øhould be tempered with the mingling of cold.</p>
                     <p>Afterwards altering, namely,
<note place="margin">Altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives.</note> cooling and moi≈øtening medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines are to be exhibited, both which prepare the humour ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by nature for concoction, ≈øuch as are, Syrrup of Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel ≈øimple, Oxymel ≈øimple, compound, Oxy≈øauharum ≈øimple, Syrrup of Sorrel, Wood-≈øorrel, the juice of Lemmon, Pome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>granate, the accidity of Endive, Cichory, Violets, Goo≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berries, the four greater cold ≈øeeds, Purcelane, Lettice, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Topical medicines are al≈øo profitable to mitigate the heat, as Epithems, Oyles, and Unguents, made of cooling things,

                     <p>The cau≈øe of this Fever is Phlegm mixed with blood in the vena cava, and there putrifying,
<note place="margin">Cau≈øe.</note> and therefore tho≈øe fall into the≈øe Fevers which are of ≈øuch an age and nature as that their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies are moi≈øter, as children and infants, as al≈øo old men and ≈øuch as have gro≈ø≈øer bodies, and are given to their bellies and to idlene≈øs, and dwell in moi≈øt places, but not young men and ≈øuch as are cholerick.</p>
                     <p>The ≈øigns of continued periodick Fevers are al≈øo manife≈øt in this Fever, only the violence is mo≈øt about the evening.
<note place="margin">Signs.</note> The heat fir≈øt is gentle, a little afterwards more ≈øharp, and ≈øome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ≈øeems to abate, and ≈øometimes to increa≈øe, by rea≈øon of the thickne≈øs of the phlegm which purri≈øieth. The pul≈øes are not ≈øo thick and frequent, the urine is not ≈øo fiery and red as in other Fevers but thicker, nor are the other Symptomes ≈øo vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as in other Fevers.</p>
                     <p>Concerning the event. 1.
<note place="margin">Progno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øticks.</note> This Fever by rea≈øon of the thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs of the humour is long, and hard to be cured, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore dangerous. And by how much the thicker the phlegm is by ≈øo much the more violent and durable, ≈øo that it is not ended before the ≈øwetieth or ≈øixtieth day, and the beginning is ≈øcarce pa≈øt before the twentieth. 2. It continueth le≈ø≈øer time where many evacuations happen. That which is pure is al≈øo longer then that which is mixed with choller, and by how much the wor≈øer Symptomes are pre≈øent, and the ≈øtrength weaker, by ≈øo much the greater danger there is, which if they are not, health is to be hoped for. 3. By rea≈øon of the duration of the Fever, and weakne≈øs of the Liver, the ≈øick for the mo≈øt part fall into Cachexy and Drop≈øie.</p>
                     <p>As to the cure this Fever is more dangerous in re≈øpect of the cau≈øe, then of its heat;
<note place="margin">Cure.</note> and therefore ≈øince it depends on phlegm that is to be heat, attenuated, cut, and afterwards being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocted and prepared, evacuated, and regard is to be had of the ≈øtrength, principally of the ≈øtomack and Liver.</p>
                     <p>Therefore in the beginning the ≈øtomack and fir≈øt ways are to be opened and evacuated by Cli≈øters and lenitive medicines,
<note place="margin">Lenitives.</note> or el≈øe the matter inherent in the ≈øtomack is to be ejected by vomit.
<note place="margin">Opening a vein.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>But although the cau≈øe of this Fever be cold, yet becau≈øe it is mixed with blood and putrifieth, ≈øome blood may be taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way by opening of a vein, in ca≈øe that the urine be thick and red, and that the ≈øtrength will bear it and the age, that nature may be ea≈øed of ≈øome part of her burthen.</p>
                     <p>Afterwards preparation &amp; concoction of the matter is to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavored with attenuating things which do not heat much;

                     <p>The ≈øecond kind of Symptomatical Fevers which is called <hi>Lenta,</hi> proceeds not from any inflamation of the bowels,
<note place="margin">Febre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentae.</note> but from ≈øome ob≈øtruction and hidden putrefaction, that is, from matter without the ve≈ø≈øels, ≈øpread over the ≈øub≈øtance of any of the interals, or at lea≈øt impacted, and putrifying in the capillar veins di≈øper≈øed neer the ≈øub≈øtance of the interals, and hath its ri≈øe from the ≈øub≈øtance of the interal decaying; whence there is ≈øo great quantity as that when the matter is gotten into larger and wider ve≈ø≈øels, vapours cannot be tran≈ømitted to the heart, and ≈øo a <hi>Febris Lenta</hi> is ≈øtirred up, which therefore is unequal and keeps no certain order.</p>
                     <p>This Fever is the gentle≈øt of all, and mole≈øteth not the ≈øick with any grievous Symptome, ≈øo that the ≈øick oftentimes thinks him≈øelf well. In the mean while the ≈øtrength decayes, that the ≈øick can ≈øcarce go forward, and the body is no ways refre≈øhed by aliment, but wa≈øteth by degrees, whence ≈øometimes this Fever is accounted with an Hectick, and therefore when there is any ≈øu≈øpition of this Fever, in the fir≈øt place we mu≈øt diligently ≈øearch the Hypocondries and Hypoga≈øtries, to try whether any tumor be to be di≈øcerned in any of them; ≈øome ≈øigns of putrefaction al≈øo will appear in the urine, and di≈øcover them≈øelves in the Pul≈øe.</p>
                     <p>This Fever is more durable, and goes beyond the terms of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Fevers, and often endeth not in fourty days, nor is it gone until the humour fa≈øtened to the interal be con≈øumed.</p>
                     <p>The third ≈øort of Symptomatical Fevers is,
<note place="margin">Fevers from pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trefaction of interals.</note> that which ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øeth from the putrefaction of any interal, from whence putred vapours through the veins in≈øerted might be ≈øent to the heart, heat that, and might ≈øtir up a continued Fever, whereby the body by degrees might be extenuated and wither.

<pb n="44" facs="tcp:36866:276"/>as the putrefaction is more or le≈øs.

                     <p>But tho≈øe <hi>Lentae</hi> or ≈ølow Fevers are known by their ≈ølow heat, wherewith notes of putrefaction in the urine and pul≈øe appear, the ≈øick are weak ≈øcarce able to go, the body wa≈øteth by little and little, and the Fever is lengthened for the mo≈øt part beyond four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty days; they are tormented by the u≈øe of purging. But when the cau≈øe of the≈øe Fevers is hidden, 'tis very hardly to be di≈øtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gui≈øhed, and therefore the Hypocondries and other internal parts are to be ob≈øerved with great diligence, and we are to enquire whether any tumor or pain be to be found there.</p>
                     <p>But tho≈øe which ari≈øe from the putrefaction of any part are more ea≈øily known, nor indeed can the corruption of the part be hidden, unle≈øs it be ignoble.</p>
                     <p>So that Fever which proceeds from corrupt milk or blood is ea≈øily known by its ≈øigns; as al≈øo that which ari≈øeth from crudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is manife≈øt from their loathing things blowing up and ≈øwelling of the Hypocondries.</p>
                     <p>Although the≈øe Fevers in re≈øpect of them≈øelves for the mo≈øt part are not dangerous becau≈øe they are mild,
<note place="margin">The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gno≈øtick.</note> yet in regard of their cau≈øes on which they depend, we ought to doubt whether

                     <p>The <hi>Febres Lentae</hi> are for the mo≈øt part long, and often con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue more then fourty days.

                     <p>But tho≈øe Fevers which proceed from corrupted mill: and blood, worms or crudity, are often acute and dangerous, and bring with them grievous Symptomes, as Epilep≈øies, Convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øions; yet they la≈øt not long, neither are they hard to be cured, but the cau≈øe being taken away they cea≈øe.</p>
                     <p>The way of cure ought to be aimed at by ≈øtriking at the cau≈øe whereon it depends.
<note place="margin">The Cure.</note> If therefore a Symptomatical Fever de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend on an inflammation of any part, the cure is to be directed to the inflammation it ≈øelf, which being cured, the Fever cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øeth. And therefore mo≈øt remedies which are convenient to a≈ø≈øwage inflammations are here u≈øeful. Yet in regard of the part affected, the way of cure ≈øometimes differs, the part affected is diligently to be weighed: Whereof it ≈øhall be ≈øpoken in the cure of particular affects.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Febres Lentae</hi> ≈øince they proceed from extraordinary ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtructions of the bowels, require opening, attenuating, and deterging medicines.

Neither are Diureticks to be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in their ≈øea≈øon. Externally al≈øo if the part affected will bear it, Emollients and Di≈øcutients are to be applied.</p>
                     <p>If the Symptomatical Fever proceed from the corruption and putrefaction of any part, that cure is to be in≈øtituted which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeth to Ulcers and Fi≈øtulaes of the internal parts.</p>
                     <p>If it be occa≈øioned by corrupt milk or blood, Worms, or crude and corrupt meats we are to endeavour that tho≈øe cau≈øes be taken away conveniently, either by vomit or clean≈øing and evacuating medicines, and together to re≈øi≈øt putrefaction and fevouri≈øh heat.</p>
                     <p>In the cure of accompanied Fevers, we are to look no le≈øs to

<note place="margin">Intermit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers.</note> But although the Ancients did extend the name of inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting Fevers more largely, and attributed the ≈øame to all Fevers which admit of ≈øome change of heat, and are ≈øome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times exa≈øperated, ≈øometimes remitted, and ≈øo to continued periodicks: yet afterwards u≈øe brought it to pa≈øs that tho≈øe Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers only were called intermittent, which ≈øometimes cea≈øe and come to that apurexy or want of fire.</p>
                     <p>The proximate cau≈øe of an intermitting Fever is a putred va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pour,
<note place="margin">their prox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imate cau≈øe.</note> elevated from the putrefaction of excrementitious hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, not continually as in continued Fevers, but by certain intervalls ≈øent to the heart, and heating the ≈øame contrary to na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
                     <p>But how it comes to pa≈øs,
<note place="margin">The fire place of Intermit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers.</note> that the putred vapour is not conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually ≈øent to the heart but at certain times is very ob≈øcure. For the explanation whereof ≈øince the knowledge of the place wherein putrefaction ari≈øeth, doth not a little conduce, and whence the putred vapours are communicated to the heart, which <hi>Galen</hi> calls the Furnace and Chimney in his 2. <hi>of the differences of Fevers,</hi> cap. the la≈øt, and in his 15. <hi>of the method of curing.</hi> cap. the fourth, that therefore is fir≈øt to be explained. But ≈øince 'tis beyond the bounds of our Breviary of In≈øtitutions to reckon up the various and different opinions of Phy≈øicians concerning it, we will here ≈øet down that opinion which we think true≈øt. The Chimney or Furnace and place wherein the matter the cau≈øe of intermitting Fevers is generated, are the Me≈øaraick
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:36866:277"/>veins, wherein the matter which ≈øufficeth to irritate each ≈øingle Paroxi≈øm, is generated during the time of its interval. And that many things which happen about intermitting Fevers do prove; namely Loathing, Vomitting, Dolor of the heart, Exten≈øion and pain of the Midriffe, Intume≈øcence about the Ventricle, Bitterne≈øs about the mouth, Belching, and ≈øuch like; for in the beginning of intermitting Fevers pure choller is often ejected by vomit in great abundance, which out of the more remote veins could not be evacuated in that manner, and about the cava of the Liver. <hi>Fernelius</hi> ≈øays he hath found the quantity of a pound by weight after the death of a Patient.</p>
                     <p>This choler being ca≈øt out the Fever is often cured, which is a ≈øign that it is the cau≈øe of the Fever, and that it is collected in tho≈øe fir≈øt ways or pa≈ø≈øages. Which Fomentations al≈øo u≈øed to the Hypocondries at the beginning of a Paroxy≈øm ≈øhews by the mitigation of the trembling and ≈øhaking.</p>
                     <p>This matter is gather'd together in the Me≈øaraick veins a long time before it brings forth a Fever, but when it begins to putre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie, grow hot, and be changed, its heat being diffu≈øed over the whole body it exciteth a Fever; which when it is di≈øper≈øed, the fevouri≈øh heat and Paroxi≈øm cea≈øeth, and the Fever leaveth ≈øo long as till new matter which in like manner putrifieth in its due time, is generated.</p>
                     <p>But although the matter which is the cau≈øe of intermitting Fevers be generated in the Me≈øaraick veins and fir≈øt pa≈ø≈øages:

Yet 'tis probable that the fevouri≈øh mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter may be communicated to the veins not principally and only in the Paroxi≈øm, but moreover ≈øome part thereof by that pa≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øage which is from the Me≈øeraick veins to the Liver continually may be carried to them; whence both by <hi>Galen.</hi> 1. <hi>de cri≈ø. cap.</hi> 7. and other Phy≈øicians a Fever is called a pa≈ø≈øion of a venemous nature. And that is fir≈øt manife≈øt from the urines, which ≈øhew evident notes of crudity and concoction in Intermittents.

<pb n="48" facs="tcp:36866:278"/>and like to theirs who are well, ≈øince that the peccant humor is then protruded by nature out of the veins towards the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of the body, and ≈øo the blood in the veins is become pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, which again in the intervals of fits is polluted by the vitious humour proceeding from the chimney of the Fever. The ≈øame is manife≈øt out of tho≈øe things which happen at the beginning of a fit, and at that time which the Greeks call Epi≈øema≈øian; for then ≈øpontaneous la≈ø≈øitudes, ≈øtretching, compre≈ø≈øion of pul≈øes, and other things happen which indicate that the matter which is to ≈øtir the Fever begins to be moved and as it were to ≈øwell in tho≈øe common ve≈ø≈øels, veins and arteries.</p>
                     <p>That vitious humour accumulated partly in the Me≈øaraick veins, partly in the vena cava when in time it putrifieth, nature ≈øtimulated and irritated oftentimes ≈øtrives ≈øeveral ways, fir≈øt by vomit and ≈øtool, afterwards by ≈øweats and urine ≈øen≈øibly to eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuate the ≈øame, as al≈øo through the pores of the skin, and by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øen≈øible tran≈øpiration it may di≈øcu≈øs the ≈øame being re≈øolved into vapours and ≈øteam.

                     <p>But becau≈øe that as long as the Fever continueth ≈øome ≈øeeds and ≈øparks are left in the granary and chimney,
<note place="margin">Cau≈øes of the return of fits.</note> and ≈øeeing that there is imbecillity in the part, 'tis nece≈ø≈øary that the humour flowing to it, although it be good, ≈øhould be defiled with that pollution and excrement which was left as it were with leaven, and through the debility of the part be corrupted, and ≈øo new matter of a future Paroxi≈øm be generated.

<pb n="49" facs="tcp:36866:278"/>later, is now another que≈øtion, and that mo≈øt intricate, which is ea≈øier to ask then an≈øwer? But that we may here forbear to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite the opinions of others, which are very many, we will men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion only that which ≈øeems mo≈øt probable to us, ≈øo far as in this humane dimne≈øs of our under≈øtanding in ≈øo ob≈øcure a bu≈øine≈øs we are able to di≈øcover. And fir≈øt, that Fevers keep ≈øuch certain periods, experience doth manife≈øt; whereby it appeareth, that ≈øome Fevers return the third, ≈øome the fourth day, and that oftentimes it ob≈øerves not only the ≈øame hour, but minute of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va≈øion although the fits may ≈øomtimes anticipate, ≈øomtimes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tard for certain rea≈øons. But the cau≈øe why paroxi≈øms return at certain times, we conceive is to be ≈øought from the diver≈øity of humours: For tho≈øe effects, as <hi>Valleriola</hi> ≈øaith, in any one ≈øort of things, which perpetually agree to the things, and are made in the like manner, into what body, and at what time ≈øoever they happen to come, the≈øe are to be referred to the proper ≈øub≈øtance of that of the which they are made; but to make return through certain days, and to irritate acce≈ø≈øions, both agrees perpetually to humors and the recour≈øes in this manner, alwaies at equal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervals (unle≈øs a perverting of the order of periods happen from el≈øe-where) are made: Therefore it ≈øhall be from ≈øuch or ≈øuch a nature of humours that the recour≈øe ≈øhall be made in the ≈øame ≈øort; namely, the cau≈øes of periods and intermitting Fevers, are excrementitious humours. <hi>Choler, Melancholy; Flegme;</hi> and tho≈øe Fevers which return the third day, proceed from a Chole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick humour; tho≈øe on the fourth from Melancholy; tho≈øe that come every day, ≈øo that they are not double Tertians, proceed from Flegme.</p>
                     <p>Yet the cau≈øe of periods cannot be drawn ≈øimply from hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, but as they acquire a peculiar quality from putrefaction or corruption, by rea≈øon whereof at a certain time, they wax hot and begin to be moved. For ≈øithence this effect is definite and determinate, which carries it ≈øelf alike in all individuals, 'tis nece≈ø≈øary that it have a certain definite and determinate cau≈øe in all individuals that are alike; which ≈øince that neither di≈øpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øition of parts, nor quantity of humours (for we ≈øee that although the ≈øtore of matter decrea≈øeth, and the fits are become ≈øhorter, neverthele≈øs they do return at their u≈øual time) nor manife≈øt quality of humour, thickne≈øs, vi≈øcidity, tenuity, or ≈øome ≈øuch like, which u≈øeth to vary, can be a quality; we mu≈øt needs fly to a peculiar and proper quality and nature of a humour; which al≈øo when it is changed, the form of the Fever it ≈øelf is changed; for when Choler is turned into Melancholy, the Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:36866:279"/>which u≈øed to come the third day, cometh on the fourth; and this quality al≈øo may afterwards remain in the humour, when the putrefaction cea≈øeth, and the Fever depending thereon. Whence, as <hi>Fornelius</hi> in his to of Fevers witne≈ø≈øeth, the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Cholick, Pains of the Joynts, and ≈øuch like di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ea≈øes ari≈øing after long continued Tertians and Quartans, do likewi≈øe keep certain periods, by rea≈øon of that di≈øpo≈øition which they have received from the corruption or putrefaction of the humours.</p>
                     <p>Yet if any one be willing to determine that the ≈øaid occult pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety is derived,
<note place="margin">Order of the fits</note> not from corruption only, but that cele≈øtial cau≈øes do al≈øo concur to its generation, I will not much contend with him; for we ≈øee that principally about the Sol≈øtices and Aequinoctials, ≈øuch Fevers, e≈øpecially the mo≈øt durable of them, do begin and end.</p>
                     <p>But although Fevers keep certain periods, yet there is a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain difference in them al≈øo; for ≈øomtimes the fit returns ju≈øt at the expected time: ≈øomtimes the following paroxi≈øme returns ≈øooner then the former; which form is called <hi>proleptick:</hi> ≈øom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the following fit comes later then the former, and that form is called <hi>Hysterick;</hi> and indeed ≈øomtimes through the whole cour≈øe of the di≈øea≈øe, ≈øuch a form is ob≈øerved, and often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times from the beginning of a Fever, until the end of the ≈øame the paroxi≈ømes anticipate, or come after the expected time: but ≈øomtimes in ≈øome there is anticipation, in ≈øome po≈øt pofition, otherwi≈øe the fits comes at the ≈øame time.</p>
                     <p>For the mo≈øt part they ≈øay,
<note place="margin">The cau≈øe of antici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation and coming late.</note> that anticipation happens when the humours by ≈øome error in diet are augmented, or are moved by medicines, anger, exerci≈øe, and ≈øuch like cau≈øes. But the fits return flower, when the matter is dimini≈øhed, or thickned: Which indeed when the accu≈øtomary paroxi≈øme is changed, that it may be ≈øo, as we do not deny; ≈øo when the Fever keeps al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ≈øome certain form, either proleptick or hy≈øterick, the cau≈øe rather ≈øeems to be taken from the diver≈øity of the humour; for although Choler, according to its manner, being corrupted, is the cau≈øe of a Tertian, Melancholy of a Quartan; yet Choler and Melancholy, according to the diver≈øity of Bodies and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peraments, do oftentimes vary ≈øomthing; Hence al≈øo it happens, that although that putred leaven, or occult quality introduced by choler, be the cau≈øe of the circuit of a Tertian, Melancholy being brought in of a Quartan: yet according to the difference of a humour, it may happen ≈øo, that the efferve≈øcence, or ferven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of humours, may come ≈øooner or later by ≈øome hours.</p>
                     <pb n="51" facs="tcp:36866:279"/>
                     <p>Concerning the longitude or brevity of ≈øome Paroxi≈øms that depends on the paucity or plenty of matter,
<note place="margin">The cau≈øe of the length of Fits.</note> di≈øpo≈øition of the humours and body: For a plentiful quantity of humours is the cau≈øe of a longer fit then a ≈ømall; ≈øo a thick humour cau≈øeth a longer then a thin, ≈øince it cannot be ≈øo ≈øoon di≈øcu≈ø≈øed as a thin. If the ≈øtrength of the body be great, which can more ea≈øily di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cu≈øs what is offen≈øive, then theirs who are weak; the ≈øhorter fit followeth: Al≈øo a thinner con≈øtitution of body, as being more apt for the di≈øcu≈ø≈øing of the matter, is the cau≈øe of a ≈øhorter fit; a thicker, of a longer. And when all the cau≈øes which occa≈øion a ≈øhort paroxi≈øm concur, a very ≈øhort fit is rai≈øed: But when all tho≈øe that produce a long are pre≈øent, the paroxi≈øm is extream long. When certain cau≈øes are pre≈øent which make a ≈øhort fit, and ≈øome are wanting of them, an indifferent betwixt both hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens.</p>
                     <p>And ≈øo much of the nature, place, and motion of the proxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate cau≈øe, which exciteth intermittent Fevers;
<note place="margin">The more remote cau≈øes of intermit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers.</note> But the more remote cau≈øes, and tho≈øe things which conduce to the generation and corruption of that matter in the Me≈øeraick veins, are meat and drink of evil juice, but yeilding matter for peccant humours an≈øwering to their own nature; and an ill di≈øpo≈øition of ≈øtomack, whereof meats turn into choler, or become ≈øour, an intemperate con≈øtitution of Ayr; for although divers humours are generated in different bodies naturally, yet if there be great vehemency of manife≈øt cau≈øes, even in bodies of different con≈øtitutions, they may produce the ≈øame humours and di≈øea≈øes depending on them.</p>
                     <p>As for the difference of intermitting Fevers,
<note place="margin">Difference.</note> they proceed from the diver≈øity of humours; for there are ≈øo many ≈øorts of inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting Fevers, as there are of humours by which they are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced; for there are according to the vulgar opinion, three ≈øorts of excrementitious humours, <hi>Choler, Flegme,</hi> and <hi>Melancholy,</hi> and ≈øo three kinds of intermitting Fevers, <hi>Bilious, Pituitous,</hi> and <hi>Melancholy;</hi> which differences we u≈øually call a Tertian in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termittent, a quotidian intermittent, and a quartane intermit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent. And in ca≈øe tho≈øe humours are ≈øincere, pure Fevers are generated; if they are mixed, ≈øpurious. And that Fever which proceeds from pure Choler, is called a pure Tertian, but that which ari≈øeth from yellow Choler mixt with ≈øome other humour, is called a Ba≈øtard Tertian.</p>
                     <p>But concerning a quotidian intermittent,
<note place="margin">Of a quoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther any be.</note> the matter is not ≈øo plain: For <hi>Fernelius</hi> accounts this the rare≈øt of all other, and ≈øcarce one of them happens among≈øt ≈øix hundred; and that tho≈øe intermittent Fevers which daylie afflict, for the mo≈øt part he rather
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:36866:280"/>accounts them double Tertians: But <hi>Platerus</hi> flatly denies a Quotidian Fever, and wholly agreeth with <hi>Galen</hi> 8. <hi>Meth. med. cap.</hi> 5. where he appoints only a twofold crudity; the one ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous, the other acid: and they only ≈øeem to afford matter for two ≈øorts of Fevers, Cholerick and Melancholy. For although Flegme al≈øo, according to preheminency, and mo≈øt principally, be called a crude humour; yet ≈øince it is exceeding cold, it can ≈øcarcely putrifie and excite a Fever.</p>
                     <p>But whether there are more circuits of Fevers,
<note place="margin">Whether there are Quintan Fevers.</note> and whether be≈øides Tertians, Quartans, and if there be any ≈øuch thing as Quotidians, there are al≈øo other Fevers which are extended be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the fifth circuit, is doubtful. <hi>Galen</hi> ≈øaw no ≈øuch: Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thele≈øs <hi>Hypocrates,</hi> and other Phy≈øitians, ob≈øerved Fevers which returned the fifth, ≈øixth, ≈øeventh, eighth, ninth day: But what the cau≈øe of this cour≈øe is, is very ob≈øcure. Some ≈øeek the cau≈øe of ≈øuch fits out of the diver≈øe con≈øtitution of Choler and Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly; and <hi>Andreas Cae≈øalpinus Art.

But mo≈øt derive the rea≈øon of the≈øe circuits from the vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous mixture of Melancholy humours with others. But although it be probable that all the≈øe Fevers, as keeping longer periods, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from a Melancholy humour; yet a mixture of that humour ≈øeems not nece≈ø≈øary: Becau≈øe no humour can be appointed to be mixed with a Melancholy, which can be a cau≈øe of a ≈ølower peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>od then it ≈øelf: for tho≈øe humours, both Cholerick and Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly, are not alwaies of the ≈øame ≈øort; and moreover, the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption al≈øo which they ≈øuffer, is not alwaies the ≈øame; ≈øo that it is no wonder that the effect al≈øo varies, which proceeding from them is not alwaies the ≈øame: And as in epidemical di≈øea≈øes, ≈øom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times rare and wonderful corruptions of humours happen, ≈øo in Intermittents, that ≈øome ≈øuch thing may likewi≈øe happen, is not altogether ab≈øurd.</p>

                     <p>Concerning the cure of the≈øe Fevers in general:
<note place="margin">Indicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Cure</note> Since their cau≈øe is collected and generated in the me≈øeraick veins, there pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trifies, and thence is diffu≈øed over all the body, and at length is di≈øcu≈ø≈øed by in≈øen≈øible tran≈øpiration or ≈øweats: But the cau≈øe of the recour≈øe of the Fever, as <hi>Galen</hi> teacheth, 2. <hi>de Febr. cap.</hi> the la≈øt is a twofold vitious di≈øpo≈øition in a body, the one a certain pollution or putrifaction left after the former paroxi≈øme; the other imbecility of the member or part, generating excrementi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious humours; what therefore is to be done in each ≈øort of Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, ea≈øily appears from hence.</p>
                     <p>For ≈øithence the beginning of generation and corruption of humours producing a Fever, is in the fir≈øt pa≈ø≈øages,
<note place="margin">Purging</note> we are to endeavour to purge out that peccant humour, before it corrupts the re≈øt of the blood, and brings weakne≈øs, and a vitious di≈øpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øition to the parts; but we mu≈øt proceed warily in tho≈øe evacua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, ≈øince there is not the ≈øame rea≈øon of all intermitting Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers: For when that vitious and excrementious humour, the cau≈øe of a Fever, in the me≈øeraicks is mixed with blood, crudity al≈øo, and concoction, according to their manner are nece≈ø≈øary; whereby the vitious humours may be ≈øeparated from the good, and rendred fit for evacuation: and that often happens in a ≈øhort time in Fevers full of Choler, and the cholerick humour is other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wi≈øe apt enough to motion: But in a Quartan the humour is more ≈øtubborn, and moreover according to <hi>Galen</hi> 1. <hi>ad Glau. cap.</hi> 11. no ≈øtrong medicine is ea≈øily to be admitted at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning.</p>
                     <p>And Sudorifiques are not at all (or altogether) to be u≈øed,
<note place="margin">Sweats</note> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le≈øs evacuations have preceded; for if many vitious and excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentitious humours do hitherto abide in the fir≈øt ways, it may ea≈øily come to pa≈øs that by rea≈øon of hydroticks untimely exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited, they may be detruded thence to the more noble parts, and may become the cau≈øe of various and grievous evils, and ≈øuch as may bring more danger then the Fever it ≈øelf.</p>
                     <p>As for breathing of a vein,
<note place="margin">Letting blood.</note> 'tis not indicated from the prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry cau≈øe of intermitting Fevers, which is generated in the me≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raick veins, where the greate≈øt part abideth: Yet becau≈øe that
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:36866:281"/>≈øomtimes blood al≈øo abounds, which may ea≈øily be corrupted and polluted by the vitious humours, and ≈øo if it be too plentiful, cannot be well governed by nature when it is weakned by a Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; and in the progre≈øs of the di≈øea≈øe, from thence ≈øome of the peccant matter pa≈ø≈øeth into the vena cava, and is mixed with the blood, it is ≈øomtimes needful to open a vein, which neverthele≈øs is not to be appointed pre≈øently in the beginning, before the eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuation of the primary pa≈ø≈øages.</p>
                     <p>If the Fever be not cured by the≈øe evacuations, we are to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour that the cau≈øes of the returns of fits may be taken away, and moreover two things remain to be done; namely, that that di≈øpo≈øition and weakne≈øs of the part generating vitious humours, may be taken away, which is performed by altering medicines, which together correct the fault of the humour, and di≈øcu≈øs that pollution, and tho≈øe ≈øeeds which were left out of the putrifacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of humours: and indeed that paroxi≈øms depend on that pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, and that when it is taken away the Fever cea≈øeth, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth from hence, That whil≈øt that is driven by nature to the circumference of the body, out of the veins, and that Pu≈øtules are rai≈øed about the lips, no≈øe, and other parts of the face, the Fever cea≈øeth

                     </head>
                     <p>AFter we have handled intermitting Fevers in general,
<note place="margin">An inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting Tertian.</note> we will now go through them in particular; among≈øt them the mo≈øt frequent is a Tertian intermitting, which ari≈øeth from Choler putrifying in the me≈øeraick veins.</p>
                     <p>But there is a certain difference of the≈øe Fevers; for fir≈øt,
<note place="margin">Its differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</note> Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler it ≈øelf out of which the≈øe Fevers are generated, is not of the ≈øame kind; for ≈øomtimes the choler is like to that natural cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler which afterwards is collected in the Galls bladder; ≈øomtimes it is preternatural green and aeruginous, ≈øuch as ≈øomtimes by tho≈øe that are Feveri≈øh, is evacuated by vomit or ≈øtool. Moreover, Choler either putrifies alone, or el≈øe hath ≈øome other humour mixt with it; Flegme or Melancholy that cau≈øeth a pure, this a ba≈øtard Tertian. They differ al≈øo in re≈øpect of duration; for if the fits are not extended beyond twelve hours, they are wont to be called pure tertians; but in ca≈øe the Fit be extended above twelve hours, they are no more called exqui≈øite and pure tertians, but either ≈øimply tertians, or ≈øpurious tertians; and when the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roxi≈øm is extended above twenty four hours, they are called ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten≈øe tertians; but this is occa≈øioned either by the thinne≈øs or thickne≈øs, plenty or paucity of the humour. For by how much the Choler is thinner or le≈ø≈øer, by ≈øo much the ≈øooner 'tis di≈øcu≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed, but by how much the thicker, or more mixed with thick humours, or the more plentiful, by ≈øo much the longer the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roxi≈øm continueth.</p>
                     <p>The cau≈øes of this Fever are all tho≈øe things which can gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate excrementitious choler, namely a hot and dry di≈øtemper;
<note place="margin">The cau≈øes genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, Choler ≈øigns of a true Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian.</note> hot con≈øtitution of ayr, cating of hot meats, and drinking of hot drinks, u≈øing of hot medicines, watching, fa≈øting, labour, and too much exerci≈øe: For although that in the Liver al≈øo yellow choler may be generated, yet it is very often generated by the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of the fir≈øt concoction, and fault of the me≈øeraick vein; therefore whether much choler be generated in the ≈øtomack by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:36866:282"/>of meats, or by default of the ≈øtomack, and is carried to the me≈øeraick veins with the chyle, and there is heaped up, and at length putrifieth, a Fever is kindled.</p>
                     <p>If the cau≈øes generating Flegme and Melancholy be annexed to tho≈øe that generate choler, ≈øpurious tertians are bred.</p>
                     <p>This Fever pre≈øently invadeth,
<note place="margin">A pure Tertian.</note> if it be pure, with a ≈øhaking fit, as it were pricking the fle≈øh; afterwards when the cold fit cea≈øeth, pre≈øently much heat followeth, ≈øharp and biting, and in its vigour is extended equally over the body, whence the ≈øick draw their breath much, and are troubled with thir≈øt. The pul≈øes in the beginning of a fit are little, weak, ≈ølow, and thin; but the fit increa≈øing, they become vehement, ≈øwift, frequent, and in ≈øome mea≈øure hard, and void of all inequalities be≈øides Feveri≈øh. When the fit comes to the height, and the ≈øick drinks, many vapours are ≈øent through the skin, vomiting of choler followeth, which of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes u≈øeth to happen after the cold fit al≈øo, the belly is loo≈øen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, choler is pi≈ø≈øed out, or ≈øomtimes more then the≈øe happen. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards a ≈øweating out of hot vapours en≈øueth over the whole body, and the pul≈øe is ≈øwift, great, vehement, ≈øuch as theirs u≈øe to be who are over-heated by exerci≈øe. The Urine is of a light red, or deep yellow, and afterwards hath a white cloud or ≈øu≈øpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion. The fit la≈øteth not above twelve hours, and the cau≈øes which generate melancholy, have either gone before, or are then pre≈øent.</p>
                     <p>A ba≈øtard tertian is known from the cau≈øes which do not ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate pure choler,

<note place="margin">Indicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Cure.</note> regard mu≈øt be had of the Fever, the cau≈øe and nature of it; the Fever indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates cooling and moi≈øtning things, the ≈øame Choler al≈øo, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the cau≈øe requireth, which al≈øo ought to be evacuated: yet if another humour be mixed with it, altering preparing and eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuating medicines, which that humour requires, are to be mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and becau≈øe the abundance of the matter is in the me≈øeraick veins, the vitious humour is to be purged out of them, and if need be, prepared before it infect the good blood: afterwards al≈øo it is to be altered, and the di≈øpo≈øition of the part generating peccant humours to be corrected. La≈øtly, We mu≈øt endeavour that the pollution and putrifaction may be di≈øcu≈ø≈øed by Sudori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiques.</p>

<note place="margin">A Quoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian Fever</note> which becau≈øe it takes them every day, is called a quotidian. <hi>Fernelius</hi> writes that this is the rare≈øt of all Fevers, and that which ≈øcarce happens once a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong≈øt ≈øix hundred: Nay there are ≈øome who plainly deny it: and although many are affected every day, yet they are ≈øick of a double Tertian, or treble Quartan.</p>
                     <p>The cau≈øe of this Fever ≈øithence it is Flegm putrifying in the me≈øeraick veins, all tho≈øe things may be cau≈øes of this Fever,
<note place="margin">The cau≈øe</note> which conduce to the generation of Flegm, namely, weakne≈øs of the bowels, e≈øpecially of the ≈øtomack, heat, cold and moi≈øt aliment, and too great plenty of them.</p>

<note place="margin">Confu≈øed</note> when two Fevers begin and end at the ≈øame time, ≈øo that they can ≈øcarcely be di≈øcerned; namely, when ≈øeveral humours confu≈øed among≈øt them≈øelves, pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trifie in the ≈øame place, and each or every of them pre≈øerves its own proper nature; which neverthele≈øs how it might be done, ≈øcarce ≈øeems po≈ø≈øible:
<note place="margin">Implicite</note> But implicite are tho≈øe that are ≈øo joyned together, as that the nature and ≈øymptomes of either of them ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verally and peculiarly may be known.</p>
                     <p>That complication happens many ways; for fir≈øt, a non-putred is joyned with a putred, as a hectick with a putred; moreover a putred with a putred, and that ≈øeveral ways; for fir≈øt, continued are mixed with continued, and intermittent with intermittent; and that either of the ≈øame ≈øort, whence there are double Terti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, double and treble Quartans; or different, but that is rarer, as a Tertian intermitting with a Quotidian intermitting, and a Tertian intermitting with a Quartan intermitting, continued Tertians with intermitting, when a Tertian intermitting with continued Quotidian, or an intermitting Quotidian with a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued Tertian is mixed, which Fevers are called Semi-Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians.</p>
                     <p>There are three ways of compo≈øition of Fevers,
<note place="margin">Three ways of compo≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Fevers.</note> and three dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences of compounded Fevers; Subintrante, Coalternate, and Communicant.</p>
                     <p>Subintrante are, when the fit of the one Fever begins before the termination of the other: Coalternate, when one paroxi≈øm being-ended, by and by after a ≈øhort interval, another begins a Communicant are ≈øuch whereof the paroxi≈øme of the one doth begin forthwith after the end of the other, there being no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terval.</p>
                     <p>Compound Fevers are known by the ≈øigns of ≈øimple Fevers,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:36866:288"/>and principally by the returns of cold tremblings and ≈øhakings af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter re≈øt;
<note place="margin">Signs of compound Fevers.</note> and in ca≈øe a cold fit happens, and ≈øweat do not follow afterwards, or that one ≈øweat happen after many fits. The pul≈øe al≈øo if in a continued Fever it be often contracted, motion of new matter, and of a new paroxi≈øm, and ≈øo 'tis a token of a compound Fever.</p>
                     <p>But the≈øe Fevers are for the mo≈øt part more dangerous then others,
<note place="margin">Progno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticks.</note> ≈øince that they more afflict the patient then ≈øimple, and a ≈øet time for their paroxi≈øms is for the mo≈øt part wanting, and e≈øpecially in ca≈øe the compound Fevers con≈øi≈øt of ≈øeveral humours, and they are more difficult to be cured, ≈øeeing tho≈øe things that are accommodated to one humour, are not fit for another.</p>
                     <p>But their cure depends on the manner of cure of their ≈øimples,
<note place="margin">Cure</note> and to every humour and Fever that is kindled, thereby are to be exhibited their oppo≈øite remedies.</p>
                     <p>But that we may ≈øay ≈øomthing of compound Fevers, we will add ≈øomwhat concerning a double and treble Tertian and Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian, and likewi≈øe of a Semitertian</p>
                     <p>A double or triple Tertian is cau≈øed by choler putrifying in two or three places in the me≈øeraick veins;
<note place="margin">A double Tertian.</note> and indeed, if choler putrifie in two places, a double Tertian is made, which afflicteth either every day once, or in one day twice, that the next day af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the ≈øick may be free from the fit:
<note place="margin">A treble Tertian.</note> But in ca≈øe it putrifie in three places, a treble Tertian ari≈øeth, which in the ≈øpace of two days afflicts thrice, one day once, the other day twice. Nay cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler may putrifie in four or five places, and more, and ≈øo many, or ≈øuch Tertians then will en≈øue.</p>
                     <p>A double Quotidian is cau≈øed by Flegme putrifying in two places,
<note place="margin">A double Quotidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an.</note> and invadeth the ≈øick twice in the ≈øpace of four and twenty hours.</p>
                     <p>A double Quartan is cau≈øed by a melancholy humour putri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying in two places;
<note place="margin">A double Quartan</note> and tho≈øe that are troubled therewith, are one day free from a Fever, and the two next are troubled with it. But ≈øuch as are troubled with a treble Quartan, are Feveri≈øh eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day; Nay, 'tis not impo≈ø≈øible but that tho≈øe that are trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with a compound Quartan, ≈øhould be affected twice in one day.</p>
                     <p>And indeed a double Tertian is often ≈øuch from the beginning,
<note place="margin">A treble Quartan</note> but a double or triple Quartan for the mo≈øt part from the untime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly u≈øe of medicines, e≈øpecially of hot ≈øodorifiques, 'tis become ≈øuch, becau≈øe the crude matter is only ≈øtirred up, but not di≈øcu≈ø≈øed, but di≈øper≈øed over more parts.</p>

                        <note place="margin">Cure</note> A compound Tertian and Quartan is cured as other Tertians
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:36866:288"/>and Quartans are: yet this is to be taken notice of, that the meats or medicines may be u≈øed at fit times in regard of the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roxi≈øme.</p>
                     <p>As for a Semitertian which by the Greeks is called a Semiter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian fire, 'tis compounded of a Tertian and a Quotidian,
<note place="margin">Semiterti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an.</note> the one continued, the other intermittent, and indeed principally of an intermitting Tertian, and continued Quotidian, and hath its continuity from Flegm, its hoirour from intermitting, as commonly 'tis taught; whence the≈øe are al≈øo called horrid Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers. But although I ≈øhould not deny that humours putrifie to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in the vena cava, and the me≈øeraick veins, and that from thence there may ari≈øe complicate Fevers, which have various exacerbations and mutations in their ≈øymptomes; yet it ≈øeems not ab≈øurd to call tho≈øe Fevers al≈øo Semitertians, which by their nature are indeed intermitting Tertians, yet when 'tis joyned with an inflammation of any Intral, a ≈øymptomatical continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Fever is ≈øtirred up; for when the Feveri≈øh part of the matter is thru≈øt out with the blood into the Guts, Stomack, Liver, and parts adjacent, an inflammation is cau≈øed, and thence a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued ≈øymptomatical Fever, which being complicate with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termitting Tertian, con≈øtitutes a Semitertian, which in re≈øpect of the intermitting Fever is horrid, in regard of the ≈øympto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical continued. That which Phy≈øitians ob≈øervations teach us, by whom 'tis found out, by the di≈ø≈øected bodies of ≈øuch as have died in Semitertians, that there are inflammations about the hollow parts of the Liver, as al≈øo in the Stomack, Guts, Me≈øentery, Kell or Cawl, Spleen; Whence 'tis ea≈øie to give a rea≈øon of a trembling or ≈øhaking fit in this Fever; for it happens ≈øomtimes ordinately, according to the nature of the intermit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Fever; ≈øomtimes inordinately, when the inflammation ≈øeizeth on ≈øome new part, or when quitture or purulent matter is made; according to <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> 2. <hi>Aphori≈øm.</hi> 4.7. Som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times malignity happens to be joyned with the≈øe Fevers, and then for the mo≈øt part they are popular, and there are many affected therewith.</p>
                     <p>This Fever is known,
<note place="margin">Signs:</note> and if it be according as it is common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly de≈øcribed, compounded of a continued Quotidian, and an intermitting Tertian, by the ≈øigns of each Fever; for a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued Fever on the one humour, daylie brings a paroxi≈øm, but the other every third day, and ≈øo in one day there will be two fits, in the other but one.

                     <p>The cure thereof depends either on the cure of an intermitting Tertian,

                     <p>A Hectick Fever is known by its continual heat, cau≈øing no pain,

The pul≈øe al≈øo in this Fever is lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,

                     <p>Medicines cooling and moi≈øtning are, Violets, Burrage,

                     <p>HItherto we have fini≈øhed the e≈ø≈øential differences of Fevers; it remains that we now ≈øhould ≈øpeak of the accidental. Among≈øt which, the principal and mo≈øt nece≈ø≈øary to be known, are tho≈øe that enfold the Pe≈øtilence, pe≈øtilential Fevers and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant.</p>
                     <p>And indeed concerning the Plague, with which,
<note place="margin">What the Plague is.</note> although not alwaies, yet mo≈øt commonly a Fever is joyned; That name is mo≈øt noted to be attributed to the mo≈øt pernitious and de≈øtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive of all others: But what the nature of that di≈øea≈øe is, among≈øt Authors is much controverted. For fir≈øt of all, ≈øithence various and ≈øeveral kinds of di≈øea≈øes and ≈øymptomes may appear in the Plague: Yet becau≈øe they are al≈øo often perceived without the plague, the nature of the plague is not to be placed in ≈øo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny di≈øea≈øes and ≈øymptomes differing in ≈øpecie, but in ≈øome pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar ≈øort: Nor doth the being epidemical or contagious, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtitute the nature of the pe≈øtilence, ≈øince other di≈øea≈øes al≈øo may be univer≈øal and contagious.</p>
                     <p>But ≈øince that this is granted by all,
<note place="margin">The plague a di≈øea≈øe of the heart</note> that the Plague ≈øpreads mo≈øt, when many are infected together with the ≈øame di≈øea≈øe, and they die, and others are infected: Hence it may ea≈øily ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, that the plague is primarily a di≈øea≈øe of that part on the which life depends chiefly, and the which being hurt, a man is in very great danger of his life, namely the heart, the fountain of life, and ≈øtore-hou≈øe of vital heat: For although the humour wherein the venome inhereth may ≈øub≈øi≈øt in divers parts (whence the ≈øame di≈øea≈øes and ≈øymptomes in every pe≈øtilence are not the ≈øame to appearance) yet in what place ≈øoever it ≈øub≈øi≈øteth, it hath
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:36866:292"/>a peculiar antipathy with the heart, and thereby de≈øtroyeth a man ≈øo ≈øuddenly.</p>
                     <p>But from whence that force and quality ≈øo mi≈øchievous and inimicous to the heart,
<note place="margin">Whether the nature of the plague con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øi≈øt in pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trifaction.</note> hath its original, and dependeth, of that there is a very great controver≈øie among≈øt Phy≈øitians; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, ≈øome do conceive that the Pe≈øtilence only con≈øi≈øteth of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trifaction, and conclude, that by putrifaction the nature of the Pe≈øtilence may be con≈øumed. But becau≈øe they them≈øelves ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge that all putred Fevers are not pe≈øtilential, they ≈øtrive variou≈øly to determine it in putrifaction, and that they divers ways ≈øtrive to explain, but all in vain. What≈øoever therefore putrifaction is concluded to be, it ≈øufficeth not to con≈øtitute the pe≈øtilence; for there are mea≈øures and degrees of putrifaction al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øo what≈øoever they are, ≈øince that they differ only according to <hi>magis</hi> and <hi>minus,</hi> they differ not in their kind, neither do they ≈øeparate the plague from the re≈øt of the putred Fevers. Moreover the Plague hurteth in another kind then a putred Fever doth; for it ≈øpreads it ≈øelf for the mo≈øt part in a moment, and brings forth pernicious effects, it diffu≈øeth it ≈øelf in an a≈øtoni≈øhing man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and into what≈øoever it enters, a very little of the pe≈øtilent venome may lie hidden any where a long time, and remain whole, and afterwards be taken into the body, and on a ≈øudden produce ≈øuch grievous ≈øymptomes, and brings forth ≈øuch effects as are not in the power of the primary qualities, on which the ground of putrifaction depends: Moreover, if the plague ≈øhould pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from putrifaction only, a Fever al≈øo would never be without the pe≈øtilence: yet ≈øince it is ob≈øerved that a Fever is without the plague, as out of <hi>Hippocrates</hi> 3. <hi>epid. comm.</hi> 4.25.55. <hi>Galen de ≈øimp. med. facult. de terra Armenia. Jac. de partib. in</hi> 1. <hi>quarti Avicen. cap. de Febre Pestilent. Alex. Benedicto, Fr. Valleriola loc. comm. lib.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 18. and out of others it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe≈øt. La≈øtly, the way of cure is far different from that of other putred Fevers, and the pe≈øtilent poy≈øon indicates and requires a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexipharmall means, which in other putred Fevers are neither indicated nor have any place.</p>
                     <p>Therefore we have determined that the plague doth con≈øi≈øt in a hidden quality, and in its nature wholly adver≈øe to the heart, and that the pe≈øtilential poy≈øon is endued with ≈øuch a quality, which by the effects of it, as we lately ≈øaid, beyond the primary qualities doth prove.</p>
                     <p>Contagion is joyned with the pe≈øtilence, and pe≈øtilential poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øons have always contagion joyned with them as a proper acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, becau≈øe it belongs to all plagues, but not only to the plague.</p>
                     <pb n="77" facs="tcp:36866:292"/>
                     <p>Therefore we define the pe≈øtilence to be a venomous di≈øea≈øe of the heart, from venomous matter,
<note place="margin">Definition of it.</note> and in its whole ≈øub≈øtance pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarly adver≈øe to the heart, and gotten by infection, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is of it ≈øelf infectious, and ≈øuddenly and joyntly hurting all the actions of the heart, very acute, deadly, introducing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtructive ≈øymptomes of all ≈øorts.</p>
                     <p>But what the ≈øpecifique nature of this venome is, and what its differences are in divers con≈øtitutions pe≈øtilential, no man can ea≈øily explain. To me it ≈øeems probable to be the highe≈øt degree of corruption, which indeed the humours in our bodies can po≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øibly receive; to which through many alterations, mutations, and fermentations it comes, and into which di≈øea≈øes which went before, at length degenerate: Whence it comes to pa≈øs, that when the Plague reigns, other ≈øporadick di≈øea≈øes that come not by or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary means, and all benigne di≈øea≈øes for the mo≈øt part are ≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, and tho≈øe epidemical di≈øea≈øes that reigned before cea≈øe.</p>

                     <p>To which thing A≈øtrologers teach, that <hi>Saturn</hi> doth prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally act his part. Moreover the Ayr may receive its pe≈øtilential ≈øeeds from the caverns of the earth, whil≈øt from thence venomous ≈øteams exhale, being generated in the ayr long pend up before; to which purpo≈øe Earthquakes much conduce, which move venomous ≈øteams in that manner, and open ways for their evaporation; ≈øo out of a che≈øt which hath been long ≈øhut, being opened, the plague cometh forth, as <hi>Julius Capito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linus</hi> hath noted in <hi>Vero:</hi> The ≈øame may happen in ≈øtanding pools and lakes, and corrupted waters in Wells.

                     <p>Secondly, although the ≈øtars by corrupting of the ayr may be the cau≈øe of the pe≈øtilence whil≈øt they ≈øo corrupt it, as that that pe≈øtilence which is contained in it, the ≈øeeds or ≈øparks being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to man, they excite the plague in him: yet by it ≈øelf al≈øo, by affecting of mans very body, they may cau≈øe the plague, whil≈øt either they di≈øpo≈øe the ayr ≈øo, that whether by manife≈øt or occult qualities, 'tis rendred not fit for the pre≈øerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of mankind, but corrupteth the humours therein, ≈øo that they become of a pe≈øtilential nature; or al≈øo proximately and immediately by occult influencies, they corrupt mans body, and principally the humours and ≈øpirits contained therein; concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which thing A≈øtrologers are to be advi≈øed with.

                     </p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Pe≈øtilential venome may be generated from common Diet.

                     <p>ANd the≈øe are the cau≈øes, by means whereof the pe≈øtilent poy≈øon may be generated in the ayr, or in mans body; yet it often comes to pa≈øs, that neither the ayr, nor evil diet, nor any of the re≈øt of the≈øe cau≈øes have ≈øtirred up the pe≈øtilence, but otherwi≈øe from el≈øewhere being brought into ≈øome place by contagion, and afterwards by contagion al≈øo it is diffu≈øed into more places.
<note place="margin">Infection.</note> For although there are other di≈øea≈øes contagious al≈øo, yet the plague is the mo≈øt infectious of all others.</p>
                     <p>Contagion is a production of the like di≈øea≈øed or ≈øickly affect in another body, by pollution ≈øent out from a di≈øca≈øed body, but there are three things required to perfect contagion: A contagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous body it ≈øelf that may infect others, a di≈øea≈øe or an affect con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to nature, which is communicated to another, and the body which is infected.</p>
                     <p>Fir≈øt, a contagious body is that which whil≈øt 'tis ≈øick of any di≈øea≈øe, diffu≈øeth not the di≈øea≈øe it ≈øelf (for the actident goes not out of the ≈øubject) but ≈øome of the morbifique cau≈øe out of it ≈øelf, and communicates it to another, and ≈øo in this manner excites the ≈øame di≈øea≈øe in it. For that which is communicated to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other from out of a contagious body, is not the di≈øea≈øe it ≈øelf, but a certain body flying out of the di≈øea≈øed body, and received into another, having power of ≈øtirring up the ≈øame in it. The Greeks call it <hi>No≈øeras apocri≈øcis,</hi> and <hi>aporroias,</hi> and <hi>mia≈ømata:</hi> The Latines, the pollutions and ≈øeeds of contagion; and ≈øince that we ≈øee that ≈øuch ≈øeeds have not only hurtful qualities in the ≈ømalle≈øt quantities, and that they ea≈øily in≈øinuate them≈øelves into the body, but al≈øo they endure a long time, and retain their ≈øtrength entire, and they are mo≈øt exactly mixed, and are ≈øome way ≈øpirituous,
<note place="margin">Infection how many ways it is ≈øpread.</note> and 'tis nece≈ø≈øary they ≈øhould ≈øowe their ≈øtore of ≈øtrength by ≈øome occult quality.</p>
                     <p>But contagion is not ≈øcattered after one manner, for ≈øomtimes it goes out by breathing, ≈øomtimes through the pores of the skin, or in the form of vapours, or of ≈øweat and filth adhering to the skin, and is communicated to other bodies. And this ≈øeed go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth out mo≈øt plentifully from an infected body, when the poy≈øon is too ≈øtrong for nature, and overcomes it, which happens in tho≈øe that are dying.</p>
                     <pb n="80" facs="tcp:36866:294"/>
                     <p>The ≈øeeds of contagion are communicated either by immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate contact, or by ≈øome medium and vehicle. This vehicle is twofold; ayr, and ≈øome fewel, as they call it: Ayr, when it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives the ≈øeeds of contagion from infected bodies, it can carry them to places nigh, yea and ≈øomtimes more remote places. That hath the nature of fewel in it, which can receive the ≈øeeds of contagion, and communicate the ≈øame to another; which kind of bodies are thin and porous, as Flax, Cotton, Feathers, the hairy skins of animals, and garments made of them, feathers al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øo of birds, and birds them≈øelves; and it is found out for a truth, that tho≈øe pe≈øtilential ≈øparks have often lain hid in the cinders or a≈øhes; and it may come to pa≈øs, that any one may carry the ≈øparks of it about him in his garments, and not be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, and yet they being moved and ≈øhaked, may infect an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other.</p>
                     <p>But the ≈øeed of a contagious pe≈øtilence when 'tis received into a body, it brings in that di≈øpo≈øition with it wherewith that body from out of which it came was afflicted, and that for the mo≈øt part ≈øuddenly, yet ≈øomtimes it is found to lie hid ≈øome days in the body before it denudates it ≈øelf.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Concerning the body that receives the pe≈øtilent trea≈øury, although no man can promi≈øe to him≈øelf immunity from the pe≈øtilent venome, yet it is certain ≈øome are more ea≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ≈øome more hardly infected. The cau≈øe whereof without all doubt con≈øi≈øteth in ≈øome peculiar occult quality of the heart, by the power whereof it hath or hath not ≈øtrength to re≈øi≈øt the veno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous pe≈øtilence; yet becau≈øe the venomous quality is not tran≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred without a ≈øubject out of the infected body into another, it will more powerfully in≈øinuate it ≈øelf if it be received into a body proportionable and like unto that wherein it was generated: whence kin≈ømen are ≈øooner affected then others. Yet there are al≈øo other things that occa≈øion the more facile reception of the pe≈øtilence; for ≈øuch as breath ≈øtronger, and ≈øuch as have wide and open pores of their bodies, ea≈øier take in the ≈øeeds of the plague, inhering in the Ayr, or any place apt to retain it.</p>

<note place="margin">Diagno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtick ≈øigns</note> that I may ≈øay nothing of approaching ≈øigns, de≈øiring brevity, but only by what means it may be known we will ≈øpeak. Indeed the plague when many have been infected, may ea≈øily be known; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore many have been over≈øpread thereby, there is ≈øcarce any path<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ognomick ≈øigne by which it can certainly be known, that one or a few being affected are ≈øick of the plague; afterwards when more are vi≈øited, it is not ≈øo difficult to be known, e≈øpecially when all ≈øporadick di≈øea≈øes for the mo≈øt part are ≈øilent: For fir≈øt, the plague ≈øeizeth on many, and the mo≈øt it kills. Secondly, 'Tis contagious, and ea≈øily given to others, and 'tis more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious then any other di≈øea≈øe. Thirdly, by its violence it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtroys the ≈øtrength, and principally the vital ≈øpirits. Whence fourthly, when little, frequent, and unequal pul≈øes are made, palpitation of the heart happens, lipothymie, ≈øyncope, and great angui≈øh and perplexity altogether. Fifthly, If the di≈øea≈øe be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted, and the venome corrupt the humours, evils and ≈øym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptomes happen of all kinds, and the whole order of the body is di≈øturbed; Fevers happen, divers wheals or pu≈øtules, buboes, carbuncles; yet if there are no pu≈øhes, bubo, or carbuncle ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, we mu≈øt not therefore conclude that the ≈øick hath not the plague; for it often happens that before they come out, and can be drived out by rea≈øon of the debility of nature, the ≈øick die with the violence of the di≈øea≈øe. There happens likewi≈øe other ≈øym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptomes of all ≈øorts; for when the ≈øtrength of the body is debili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated by the vehemency of the poy≈øon, the humours and ≈øpirits are corrupted, the excrements are changed, and the urine either becomes crude, or fully corrupted, the ≈øweats are ≈øtinking and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timely, filthy, foetid, ill coloured excrements proceed from the belly, the qualities of the body are variou≈øly changed, and there is nothing at all in burning and malignant Fevers, which may not appear likewi≈øe in the pe≈øtilence:
<note place="margin">Progno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øticks</note> But there is no di≈øea≈øe at all to which the Aphori≈øm of <hi>Hippocrat.</hi> 19. <hi>≈øect.</hi> 2. doth more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree: for oftentimes when the plague flatters mo≈øt, it brings un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected death; and on the contrary, tho≈øe that have ≈øeemed de≈øperate, often recover when pa≈øt hope.</p>
                     <p>But there is the more hopes when tumors come forth ≈øuddenly in a place that is not dangerous, and after their coming forth the
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:36866:295"/>≈øymptomes abate, al≈øo if the wheals are of a good colour, and with remi≈ø≈øion of ≈øymptomes; if medicines, meat and drink are not vomited up again, if ≈øweats come out with light≈øom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs to the ≈øick, and other ≈øigns are di≈øcerned, which u≈øe to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øent in ≈øalutary Fevers.</p>
                     <p>But the greate≈øt danger is, when tumors come not enough out, and carbuncles draw near to the heart, or vani≈øh again; if gid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dine≈øs in the head, watchings, a coma, or convul≈øion fits are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øent, if the ≈øick ≈øhall ≈øay every thing ≈øtinketh, if trembling of the heart, fainting of the ≈øpirits be pre≈øent, if all things are thrown up by vomiting, if the extremities of the body wax cold, if the ≈øweat be cold, if the excrements are of divers colours, black, and ≈øtinking, and if the other ill ≈øymptomes of malignant Fevers be pre≈øent.</p>

                     <p>The fir≈øt is, That all tho≈øe cau≈øes that may occa≈øion the ≈øick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs may be avoided.</p>

                     <p>Fir≈øt therefore if the Plague reign any where, all commerce with the infected is to be avoided, and if any one be certainly infected, he ≈øhould be ≈øeparated from the re≈øt with all his hou≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold-≈øtuff, indeed for many weeks, and the hou≈øe infected (as hereafter ≈øhall be ≈øhewed) clean≈øed; and in ca≈øe it be doubtful whether any one be ≈øick of it or no, 'tis better to be too cautious then carele≈øs.</p>
                     <p>But if the pe≈øtilence be now ≈øown in any place, 'tis ≈øafe≈øt to remove from thence, according to that common ver≈øe,

                     <p>And that we may begin <hi>a posteriore,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Purging.</note> the body is not to be ra≈øhly weakned with ≈øtrong medicines; yet if any vitious humour ≈øhall be in the body, le≈øt that the force of the Alexipharmacal me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines ≈øhould be debilitated, or the venomous poy≈øon ≈øhould ea≈øily take root in the body, it is to be purged by little and little with lenitives; to which purpo≈øe the mo≈øt profitable are pills of Ruffi, ≈øo called from the authors name, and by cu≈øtome called Pe≈øtilential pills; out of which al≈øo is made the Elixir proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatis, oyl of Vitriol being thereunto added: Syrup of Ro≈øes ≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutive is al≈øo profitable, and Rhubarb, Agarick, and medicines compounded with them, which are every where extant. If blood abound, it may be abated by opening of a vein.</p>
                     <p>The Diet ought to be ≈øuch,
<note place="margin">Diet.</note> whereby vitious humours may not be cumulated; and with meats and drinks mo≈øt principally things good again≈øt poy≈øon ≈øhould be mixed; and al≈øo, if as it may ea≈øily happen, any of the vitious humours be cumulated, let them be purged by the ≈øaid medicines.</p>
                     <p>And fora≈ømuch as Fontanels take away excrementitious hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours by little and little, and hence take away the provi≈øion for the plague, they al≈øo in pe≈øtilential times are profitable.</p>
                     <p>Mediocrity al≈øo is to be kept in exerci≈øe and re≈øt, ≈øleeping and waking, and the pa≈ø≈øions of the mind, and principally as much as 'tis po≈ø≈øible, intentive thoughts of the plague, and fear of the ≈øame is to be ≈øhaken out of our minds.</p>
                     <p>Be≈øides the≈øe, two things more are yet nece≈ø≈øary for our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øervation from the plague: Fir≈øt to take heed that none of the pe≈øtilential ≈øeed be attracted; Furthermore, if that happen, we being ignorant thereof, our bodies ≈øhould be fortified again≈øt it.</p>
                     <p>Fir≈øt therefore we ≈øhould endeavour that the Ayr wherein we live be pure;
<note place="margin">The Ayr how to be purified.</note> and therefore fir≈øt publike places are to be clean≈øed from all filth, and the ayr ≈øhould be purified with fire, principally of the wood of Juniper, Oak, Pine, Bays, and odoriferous plants being kindled; furthermore, every one ≈øhould avoid company, and therefore ≈øolemn and frequent meetings are ju≈øtly forbid by the Magi≈øtrate.

                     <pb n="84" facs="tcp:36866:296"/>
                     <p>No man ≈øhould go abroad until the Sun be an hour or two high,
<note place="margin">How every man ought to fortifie him≈øelf a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Plague.</note> neither fa≈øting, nor unarmed with alexipharmacal things, therefore balls of Amber, Nodules, ≈øweet Limments mixed with Treacle, oyl of Rue, Znezedoaric, Angelica, Citron, Juniper, and ≈øuch like ≈øhould be held to the no≈øtrils, and under the tongue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient troches ≈øhould be held, cordial bags ≈øhould be applied to the region of the heart.</p>
                     <p>Amulets likewi≈øe of poy≈øonous things are commended by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,

<note place="margin">Cure.</note> ≈øince that the ≈ømalle≈øt fault being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by any, may become an irreparable damage: But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe the right rea≈øon of Cure depends on indications, and ≈øee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the Plague is an occult di≈øea≈øe, and its nature con≈øi≈øts in an occult quality, which by its peculiar force is mi≈øchievous to the heart, and is very contagious; but that is introduced by a cau≈øe endued with the ≈øame quality; Hence 'tis manife≈øt, that that occult quality indicates a medicine alexipharmacal contrary to it, and ≈øhews that the cau≈øe in the body, whether taken by breathing in, or contact, or by what means ≈øoever contracted, ≈øhould be removed and eradicated; But how that ought to be done, is controverted among≈øt Phy≈øitians.</p>
                     <p>For fir≈øt, ≈øince that neither Phlebotomy,
<note place="margin">Breathing a Vein.</note> nor Purgation are indicated by the pe≈øtilence, quatenus 'tis the pe≈øtilence, whether they are to be u≈øed or not is controverted.</p>
                     <p>Fir≈øt, Concerning the opening of a Vein, ≈øince that it nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cures the di≈øea≈øe, nor takes away the venome, nor the cau≈øe, 'tis rarely to be u≈øed, and in that Pe≈øtilence which is occa≈øioned by evil Diet, 'tis wholly to be omitted, as al≈øo in that which ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øeth from a pe≈øtilential con≈øtitution of Ayr, unle≈øs there be very
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:36866:297"/>great ≈øtore of blood which mu≈øt be dimini≈øhed, and its heat mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigated: But if the Plague come by infection, and there be that plenty of blood as may cau≈øe us to fear le≈øt that a putred Fever ≈øhould happen, which may become no le≈øs dangerous to the ≈øick then the Plague it ≈øelf, or that it be ob≈øerved that the blood flows violently to inconvenient places, and that the ≈øtrength is rather oppre≈ø≈øed by its plenty, then di≈ø≈øipated, you may breath a Vein, yet only bleed what the ≈øtrength can well bear with; and that ≈øhould be in the beginning, for when twelve hours or more are pa≈ø≈øed away, 'tis ≈øafer to omit bleeding, becau≈øe the ≈øtrength be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing debilitated with the violence of the poy≈øon, it cannot well bear it. Concerning the place for breathing of a Vein, ≈øuch a place is to be cho≈øen, as may help the motion of Nature, not hinder it, and may together divert the pe≈øtilent matter from a noble part; Therefore if a Parotis break out behind the ears, or a Bubo under the Arm-pits, or a Carbuncle in the ≈øuperiour parts, a Vein ≈øhould be opened in the Arm on the ≈øame ≈øide; but if a Bubo come in the Groyn, a Vein ≈øhould be opened in the foot on the ≈øame ≈øide. But if a Carbuncle ≈øhould ari≈øe in either of the Legs, ≈øeeing that u≈øeth to cau≈øe an inflammation, and great pain, by which the ≈øtrength is weakned, 'tis convenient to open a Vein in the contrary leg; for neither is the motion of nature hindred by this means, but the matter is drawn from the ≈øuperiour parts towards the inferiour, and a great flux to the part affected, and the increa≈øe of the inflammation is hereby pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented.</p>
                     <p>Moreover Purgation al≈øo is not indicated by the pe≈øtilence,
<note place="margin">Purgation.</note> nor can the ≈øeeds of the Plague be eradicated by any purging medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine, unle≈øs perhaps a great di≈øturbance of nature being made, which mu≈øt then be joyned with danger: and for as much as Nature for the mo≈øt part expels the pe≈øtilent venome to the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parts of the body, this motion of Nature by Purgation is hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, and the pe≈øtilent venome is drawn into the internal parts, and is more mixed with the humours, and the motion of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours being ≈øtirred up, mo≈øt dangerous, nay deadly vomits and ≈øluxes are occa≈øioned: And therefore not in purging, but in medicines that re≈øi≈øt poy≈øon, principally, and next under God the hope of health and ≈øafety is to be placed.</p>

                     <p>But we have already determined that there are no Ephemeraes nor Hecticks pe≈øtilent and malignant, becau≈øe that in all pe≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and malignant Fevers, there are manife≈øt tokens of corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption or putrefaction of humours, although that malignant and pe≈øtilent humour have likewi≈øe a manife≈øt antipathy with the ≈øpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, and may ≈øtir up a dangerous Fever.</p>

                     <p>But as to the ≈øigns of their differences, if both malignity and putrifaction be very much, the ≈øtrength will be much weakned, and grievous, nay the mo≈øt dangerous ≈øymptomes appear: If the putrifaction be very great, the malignancy little, the feveri≈øh ≈øymptomes which accompany putrifaction are vehement enough, but the ≈øtrength is not ≈øo much debilitated.

                     <p>Of both kinds there are ≈øome differences; for of <hi>Variolae,</hi> ≈øome are greater, ≈øome le≈øs; ≈øome white, others yellow, or of ≈øome other colour; ≈øome break out forth with, and ri≈øe high, and are ripened and encompa≈ø≈øed with a red circle, and come forth without any grievous ≈øymptomes, and are not dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous; others are yellow, come forth ≈ølowly, and pre≈øently pitch again, and have a livid circle about them, and are dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous.</p>
                     <p>To the <hi>Variolas</hi> belong tho≈øe pu≈øtules al≈øo which break out of the body, and are about the bigne≈øs of Lupines,

                     <p>The ≈øubject of ≈øpots and pu≈øhes is the skin,
<note place="margin">Subject.</note> and other parts an≈øwering to the skin in proportion; for it hath been found in dead bodies, that the ≈øuperficies of the Intrals, and on their skin without ≈øide the Pox have been ≈øetled.</p>
                     <p>Concerning the cau≈øe of the≈øe,
<note place="margin">Cau≈øe.</note> there is difficult and great controver≈øie among≈øt Phy≈øitians; The Arabicks, and tho≈øe which follow them, attribute the cau≈øe of the ≈ømall Pox and Mea≈øles to the uncleanne≈øs of the blood, contracted from the men≈øtruous blood in the womb, by the Infant which was there nouri≈øhed with it; for they ≈øay, that this filth being left in the body, doth lie ≈øtill, like unto leven, until ≈øtirred; ≈øo that
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:36866:303"/>the whole blood, boyls like new wine, and ≈øo what≈øoever is in it of impurity, is ≈øeperated and ≈øent to the out-≈øide of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; and they therefore ≈øay ≈øo, becau≈øe they ob≈øerved that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo≈øt all men at ≈øome time are troubled with the Pox or Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øles, and tho≈øe which have had them once or twice, for the mo≈øt part are free from them ever after.</p>
                     <p>Others are again≈øt this opinion, and ≈øay, that it proceeds from ≈øome occult cele≈øtial cau≈øe, who≈øe impre≈ø≈øion, children being more infirm, are apter to take, then tho≈øe that are ≈øtrong and in years; neither do they think it probable, that Infants are nouri≈øhed in the womb with unclean blood, or that this impurity can lie hidden ≈øo long in mans body, ≈øince 'tis known that not only Infants, but youths, nay ≈øuch as are well in years, and old men al≈øo ≈øome times fall ≈øick of the ≈ømall Pox, which formerly have been ≈øick of Fevers, and troubled with ≈øcabs, in whom (in ca≈øe any impurity had been in the blood, it ought to have been then taken away.</p>
                     <p>But in regard both opinions contain difficulties in them, and both ≈øeem to be held up with probable arguments; let us joyn them together; for if the Pox and Mea≈øles are epidemical and infectious, 'tis not to be denied but that they then ari≈øe from a certain peculiar malignant di≈øpo≈øition of ayr,: Then Infants, as being more tender, ≈øooner are infected; although it cannot be denied, that from an external cau≈øe, an infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty lying hidden within, may be brought forth into action, yet if the power of the malignity be greater, tho≈øe of ripe years may ≈øomtimes be afflicted: But if the Pox or Mea≈øles come forth ≈øcattered here and there, 'tis probable that they proceed from the impurity of the womb, whereby a vitious di≈øpo≈øition of the body is contracted by the party in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy e≈øpecially if there be no fault in the Ayr; for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though an infant in the womb be nouri≈øhed with the pure≈øt blood of the mother, yet when it becomes bigger, and want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth more nouri≈øhment, it cannot be but that it mu≈øt draw ≈øome of the depraved humours which are cumulated in the womb with it. Whence it is known, that Infants have been born ≈øick of the ≈ømall Pox, or had them come forth pre≈øently after they come into the world: Yet 'tis not impo≈ø≈øible but that from ill Diet the ≈øame vitiou≈øne≈øs may be contracted, as from the men≈øtruous blood in the womb, and that may hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to tho≈øe that have had the ≈ømall Pox twice or thrice, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it may likewi≈øe happen by rea≈øon of the fir≈øt pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:36866:304"/>and defilement, of which ≈øome reliques were left.</p>
                     <p>The ≈ømall Pox and Mea≈øles alwaies come forth with a Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver;
<note place="margin">Whether any and what Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver may be joyned with the Small Pox and Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øles.</note> for they are ≈øtirred up by a certain cri≈øis, and that ebul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lition not only happens to the ≈øubcutanial veins, but al≈øo to the greater; whence heat is communicated to the heart, and a Fever is kindled, and that Fever is made a putred Synocha, as may appear by the equal heat, and the matter contained in the Pox; and that which is gentle, often vani≈øheth within a few days, neither is it regarded by Infants, nor the ≈øtanders by; but that which is more vehement, if the di≈øea≈øe be to determine with ≈øafety, will abate when the Pox comes forth; ≈øomtimes the≈øe Fevers become pe≈øtilential, and then many Infants are extingui≈øhed.</p>
                     <p>And thus the ≈ømall Pox and Mea≈øles are generated from internal cau≈øes; yet external cau≈øes likewi≈øe do often concur, as humours corrupting in this manner, or lying hidden, have force of moving: The fir≈øt is Ayr, by rea≈øon of the influence of Stars, or cau≈øes otherwi≈øe ≈øo di≈øpo≈øed, as that they may cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt the humours in this manner. Moreover contagion, when a certain ≈øickly effluvium or ≈øteam from bodies di≈øea≈øed of the ≈ømall Pox or Mea≈øles, is communicated to another body, and cau≈øeth the ≈øame di≈øea≈øe therein.</p>
                     <p>But of Poxes and pu≈øhes there is certain differences, as hath been ≈øaid, in ≈øub≈øtance, quantity, and quality. According to ≈øub≈øtance, ≈øome con≈øi≈øt of this, ≈øome of that humour; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to quantity, ≈øome are big and many, others ≈ømall and few: according to quality, ≈øome are white, others red, yellow, livid, violet colour, &amp;c. Some come out ≈øuddenly, others ≈ølowly; ≈øome are pre≈øently healed and vani≈øh, others continue long; ≈øome afflict only the external parts of the body, ≈øome the internal al≈øo.</p>
                     <p>But when the Pox or Mea≈øles are coming,
<note place="margin">Diagno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtick ≈øigns.</note> there is pre≈øent pain in the head, eyes, and throat, an itching of the no≈øtrils, ≈øneezing, terror in ≈øleep, fits like epileptical ones, pain on the back, burning and pricking in the skin, difficulty of breathing, a dry cough, trembling of the feet, yawning, retching, pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation of the heart, which actions ≈øo hurt, proceeds from the ebullition of the blood, and fuliginous vapours ≈øent from the heart, and di≈øper≈øed over all the body. Their Urine is often like unto theirs who are in health, the peccant matter being thru≈øt out to the extremities of the body; yet ≈øomtimes 'tis troubled by rea≈øon of the great ebullition of humours, the he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrhodes
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:36866:304"/>of the No≈øe are frequent, tears u≈øe to fall from the eyes of their own accord, or the eyes ≈øhew as if they were ready to weep; ≈øomtimes vomiting happens, the face and eyes are red, the skin rough, the voice hoar≈øe, and la≈øtly, a Fever by the ebullition of humours is kindled; If the≈øe ≈øigns therefore for the mo≈øt part are pre≈øent, and are encrea≈øed on the third or fourth day, and certain red ≈øpots appear in the skin, 'tis a ≈øign that the Pox or Mea≈øles are at hand; and this ≈øu≈øpition is increa≈øed if the Pox reign thereabouts. A little afterwards tho≈øe ≈øpecks are exalted like grains of Mellet, and afterwards changed into pu≈øtules full of quitture, and are become Pox, or are extended abroad, and ≈ømall tubercles are made, and the Mea≈øles are produced.</p>
                     <p>The nature of humours is principally known by the colour,
<note place="margin">Signs of Cau≈øes, and of the part affected.</note> for if the pox proceed from a cholerick humour mixt with blood, they are more red, and do itch more from Flegm, they are whiter, from melancholy blacker: ≈øomtimes likewi≈øe they are of violet colour, green, lead colour, and with greater cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of humours: If they po≈ø≈øe≈øs not only the skin, but al≈øo the internal parts, the Fever is greater, thence comes great difficulty of breathing, ≈øtraitne≈øs of the brea≈øt, a greater cough, pain in the ≈øtomack and guts mo≈øt vehement.</p>
                     <p>Small Pox and Mea≈øles are numbred among≈øt acute di≈øea≈øes,
<note place="margin">Progno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øticks.</note> and are terminated within fourteen days; they come forth commonly about the fourth day, they increa≈øe till the ≈øeventh, the height is manife≈øt the eleventh, and from thence to the fourteenth is the declination; but the drying of them conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nueth till the twentieth day ≈øomtimes.</p>
                     <p>The Fever adjoyned, the magnitude of ≈øymptomes, the manner of the Pox, and the ≈øtrength or the ≈øick ≈øhew the event. For if the Fever and all the other ≈øymptomes after the coming out of them do abate, if large hemorrhodes of the no≈øe have preceded, if the pu≈øtules are great, white and red, ≈øoft eminent, not alike, come forth quickly, and are ≈øoon ripened, a good event is to be hoped for.</p>
                     <p>On the contrary, the Fever if it be great, and be not mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigated after the coming out of the Pox, and the tubercles are violet colour, green, livid, haad, contiguous, come forth and ripen ≈ølowly, and the ≈øymptomes which u≈øe to be in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant Fevers be more grievous, the ≈øtrength weaker, they portend danger, and either bring death, or ≈øome great evils in the eyes, no≈øe, chops, gullet, lungs, guts, liver, reins, and leave fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy pits and ≈øcars in the skin.</p>

                     <p>There is in a manner the ≈øame rea≈øon of the Mea≈øles, which the more milde the Fever and ≈øymptomes are, the le≈øs danger; but by how much the greater, the more danger is adjoyned with them; they are ≈øooner di≈øcerned, neither are they ≈øo loth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øom to the ≈øight; red ones likewi≈øe, and tho≈øe that ≈øoon ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare are more mild, but tho≈øe that are green, violet colour, black and come forth ≈ølowly are wor≈øt.</p>
                     <p>But the wor≈øt is, when the Pox or Mea≈øles come not throughly out, or do vani≈øh again, for then by the matter left within, or returning in, a greater Fever is kindled, ≈øym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptomes become greater, and the ≈øick, for the mo≈øt part, peri≈øh.</p>
                     <p>The chief ≈øcope of the cure mu≈øt be,
<note place="margin">Indicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Cure.</note> that ≈øince Nature ≈øtrives to expel the matter to the remote parts of the body to a≈ø≈øi≈øt it: the ≈øecond is, That the pravity of the matter may be corrected: The third, That the ≈øtrength may be fortified: And la≈øtly, To take care that no part of the body receive any detriment.</p>
                     <p>The endeavours of Nature are furthered if the humours are driven out to the circumference of the body, and the impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that may di≈øturb the matter in its coming forth, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be ≈øtore of matter, or pravity of it, or ob≈øtruction of the bowels mu≈øt be taken away.</p>
                     <p>But becau≈øe this evil principally invades Infants,
<note place="margin">Bleeding.</note> breathing of a vein is not nece≈ø≈øary, ≈øince their age will not tolerate it, but if it happen in an age that will bear it, and the abundance of blood require evacuation, pre≈øently at the beginning be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the becoming out of them, a vein is to be opened, that nature being ea≈øed of part of its burthen, may the ea≈øier expel the remainder.</p>
                     <p>Strong Purges are not to be u≈øed, le≈øt nature ≈øhould be hindred in its endeavour, or a dangerous loo≈øene≈øs ≈øhould be occa≈øioned; yet if the body be bound, it may be relaxed by a lenitive Medicine or Cli≈øter, which together allays the heat of the humours, and ≈øtrengthens the internal parts.</p>
                     <p>Moreover we mu≈øt ob≈øerve whether Nature do its office in expelling;
<note place="margin">Expelling thing.</note> for then there is no need to help it with many me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines, e≈øpecially heating ones.</p>
                     <p>But if the Pox come out ≈ølowly, Nature ≈øhould be helped with expelling Medicines; yet ≈øuch things ≈øhould be mixed therewith, as may ≈øtrengthen the internal parts, mitigate the heat of the humours, and re≈øi≈øt malignity.</p>
                     <p>The expelling Medicines are, Roots and Seeds of Fennel,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:36866:305"/>Turnip, Carduus benedictus, Columbine, Limmon, the Roots of white Dittany, Burnet, Maidenhair, Marigold flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, decoction of red Par≈ønips, Scordium, Scabions, Myrrhe, Figs, Lentiles, and other things that re≈øi≈øt malignity.</p>

                     <p>Medicines of Figs, Lentiles, Lacca, and Tragacanthwere, in u≈øe among≈øt the Arabians, which were likewi≈øe u≈øed by lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Phy≈øitians; yet if the malignity be great, you may ≈øly to more exqui≈øite re≈øi≈øters of poy≈øon.</p>
                     <p>But principally we mu≈øt endeavour to beware that the ≈øick take not the fre≈øh ayr, but be rather placed in a hot place, that the pores of the skin may be kept open, and that nothing may hinder Nature in expelling,</p>
                     <p>And we mu≈øt be careful al≈øo, that the eyes, no≈øtrils,

                     <p>Whil≈øt the wheals are ripening, there will be much itching, but beware of ≈øcratching, le≈øt you thereby cau≈øe ≈øcars in the skin; if the quitture be white, and the pu≈øtules not too great, 'tis be≈øt to commit the whole bu≈øine≈øs to nature; but if they are great, or many of them joyned together, when by their whitene≈øs, ≈øoftne≈øs, and freene≈øs from pain they ≈øhall appear to be ripe enough, they may be opened with a ≈øilver or golden needle be≈øt.</p>
                     <p>Concerning Diet,
<note place="margin">Diet.</note> the ≈øick by all means mu≈øt be kept from the cold ayr, neither mu≈øt he be kept too hot, le≈øt it make him faint: The manner of Diet as in other acute Fevers, is to be appointed, namely thin; yet to Infants, if their ≈øtomacks will bear it, ≈øome meat may be given, becau≈øe their bodies are not diaphoretick, and by rea≈øon of their ≈øtore of innate heat, cannot ≈øo well endure fa≈øting: from meats that are ≈øalt, acrid,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:36866:306"/>flat, which may increa≈øe an ebullition of humours, we mu≈øt refrain, and tho≈øe that moderately cool and bind, and allay the heat of the blood, mu≈øt be admini≈øtred. Wine at the fir≈øt is not convenient, but rather ≈ømall Beer, or Barley water; but in the progre≈øs of the di≈øea≈øe, when the ≈øymptomes ≈ølacken, to tho≈øe that are accu≈øtomed to it, a little of the ≈ømalle≈øt wine may be granted.</p>
                     <p>There ought to be temperate moderation of the other non-naturals likewi≈øe, watchings and ≈øleep, the ≈øick ≈øhould ≈øleep moderately: In the beginning of the Pox or Mea≈øles, there ≈øhould be gentle frictions of the legs and arms u≈øed, whereby the humours might be called out to the circumference of the body. 'Tis in u≈øe to put a red cloth to the bed in the ≈øight of the ≈øick, to cau≈øe motion of humours to the exteriour parts. The Belly ≈øhould be kept open with a gentle Cly≈øter, if need require: La≈øtly, all vehement perturbations of the mind mu≈øt be avoided, e≈øpecially anger and fear.</p>
