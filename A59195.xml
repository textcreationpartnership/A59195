            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <p>OF all the Arts and Sciences that the Sons of Men ſo much covet after, there is none ſo pleaſant and profit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able as <hi>Phyſick; Phyſick</hi> doth not onely teach thee to preſerve thy ſelfe from the aſſaults of thoſe manifold Enemies which Nature is li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able unto, but it teaches thee to reſtore Health when loſt, and to heal thy ſelfe though wounded by thy greateſt adverſary; beſides in the Anatomical part it enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains thy fancy with the wonderfull work of Nature
<pb facs="tcp:36866:4"/>where the unſearchable wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the Creator is as le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible, as in thoſe things we count more ſublime and Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtial; which if conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, Phyſicians cannot be ſo Atheiſtical as the world re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports them to be.

<note place="margin">The Defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition of Phyſick.</note> Yet afterwards when that part was added, which ſhewed the preſervation of preſent health; the ſame ancient Appellation was ſtill retained, and is now attributed to the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:36866:11"/>whole Art. Phyſick is an Art (as far as it is poſſible) of preſerving mans preſent health, and reſtoring it when it is loſt.</p>
                     <p>Phyſick is moſt properly ſet down amongſt the Arts,
<note place="margin">The Genus of Phyſick.</note> becauſe it propounds to it ſelf, not knowledge onely, but effecting ſomewhat; namely, gaining of health. For the diſtinction betwixt Diſciplines are taken from their next end: neither doth Phyſick obſerve the other principles that are requiſite in a Science.</p>
                     <p>The Subject of Phyſick is mans Body,
<note place="margin">The Subject of Phyſick.</note> as it is indued with health, and obnoxious to diſeaſes. And this Subject hath one excellency peculiar to it ſelf, beyond the Subjects of all other Arts; in that they do nothing, onely they perform obedience, and undergo the operation of the Artificer; but this hath a certain in-bred power ſtriving for health of its own accord.</p>
                     <p>The End of Phyſick is Health;
<note place="margin">The End of Phyſick.</note> and that is the true and laſt aim of it, the firſt mover, and that for which it is; but the ſcope or means, and that to which it aims is to heal, as <hi>J. C. Scaliger</hi> in his firſt Book of Plants teacheth; for although the Phyſitian do not alwaies obtain his chief end, ſince it is impoſſible to cure all that are ſick, yet the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>hyſitian hath performed his Office, if he have omitted none of thoſe things that are in the power of Nature and Art.</p>
                     <p>For out of thoſe two the Excellency and Dignity of Phyſick is manifeſted;
<note place="margin">The Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of Phyſick.</note> for it is imployed about mans Body, of all natural Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies the moſt noble. The end it aims at is health; then which (amongſt all things that may be called good by Mortals) nothing is better; and that which alone is ſought by it ſelf. Whereas all the reſt of the Arts aim at nothing themſelves; but perform all things becauſe of ſome outward end.</p>

For ſithence a Phyſitian cannot heal unleſſe he know the Subject whereon he ought to work, and ſince all Arts begin from the knowledge of their end: firſt he ſhould acquire the knowledge of mans body, wherein he ought to work, and wherein health doth conſiſt, 'tis neceſſary he ſhould underſtand; and ſince that a diſeaſe is repugnant to health, he ought to know the nature, differences, cauſes and effects of a diſeaſe; and by what rules to find theſe in every individual.

                           <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of health.</note> when they can rightly perform the natural and neceſſary actions of life, Health is defined fitly to be a power of mans body to perform thoſe actions which are according to nature, depending on the natural conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:36866:12"/>of all the parts: for health doth not conſiſt in the action it ſelf, ſince that thoſe who ſleep, or are quiet in what manner whatſoever, and ceaſe from certain actions, are ſound, and as <hi>Galen</hi> hath it in the 2 <hi>cap.</hi> of the differences of diſeaſes; not to operate, is to be well, but to be able to operate: nor is he onely well who performs his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural actions; but alſo he that doth them not, ſo that he be able to do them: And ſo the formal reaſon of health is, a potency of body to perform natural actions; but becauſe <hi>Galen</hi> in the place above-mentioned, makes health to be a natural conſtitution of all the parts of the body, and in the firſt Chapter of the Differences of Symptomes, a framing made according to nature fit for operation, or a natural conſtitution of all the parts of the body, having power to undergo thoſe things which are according to nature; therefore it comes to paſſe, that that poſition or conſtitution is rather ſubject to the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of a Phyſitian, then to the power of acting.</p>
                     <p>The ſubject of health is a living body,
<note place="margin">The Subject of health.</note> or the parts of a living bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, as to that, to which alone the power of acting belongs; but thoſe which live not, and have no power to perform natural actions, thoſe are neither ſaid to be ſick nor well.</p>
                     <p>But the cauſe of health,
<note place="margin">The effici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent cauſe of health.</note> or that whereby a body and its parts are ſaid to be ſound, is a natural conſtitution of them: But ſeeing there is a twofold conſtitution of a body, and of all its parts, the one Eſſential, which conſiſts of matter, and ſubſtantial form; the other accidental, which follows the former, and is ſuch a diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of qualities and other accidents in the ſeveral parts of the body, by which the eſſential form may exerciſe all its acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and according to its diverſity, it acteth variouſly: Health doth not conſiſt in the eſſential but accidental conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution; for the mind cannot be hindred or hurt, but remains alwaies the ſame and unchanged; ſo that it have inſtruments conſtituted in the ſame manner. The Eſſential conſtitution alſo, ſo long as a man lives, is immutable, and at length is changed by death; but the accidental conſtitution of the body is ſubject to many altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, whence the ſame ſoul in the ſame body acts one way and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way.</p>
                     <p>And becauſe the parts of the body are ſeveral, the natural conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of them alſo is not the ſame.
<note place="margin">The defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimilar parts.</note> The parts of the body are two-fold, ſimilar, and diſſimilar. Similar parts are ſuch whoſe par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles have the ſame form, and are alike to the whole, and to one another; and indeed, ſome are truely and exactly ſuch, wherein no difference can be found, neither by accurate ſenſe, nor by reaſon: ſuch are a Bone, a. Griſtle, ſimple fleſh, a very ſmall vein, Fat: Others are ſo onely to the ſenſe, which although at the firſt ſight they
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:36866:12"/>ſeem ſuch; yet if they are viewed more diligently, they are percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to be compoſed of more, as fleſh of muſcles, ſubſtance of Veins, Nerves, Arteries.</p>
                     <p>Diſſimilar, are ſuch as are compounded of more,
<note place="margin">Of a Diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milar. Whether a ſimilar part be oppoſite to an orga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick.</note> which are alſo called for the moſt part organick. For although, if we may ſpeak properly, an Organick is not oppoſite to ſimilar, but a diſſimilar or compound, and ſimilar may be organick alſo, as you may ſee in bones, which have their organick conſtitution: Yet becauſe ſingular parts, for the moſt part, do not perform a whole and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire action, which <hi>Galen</hi> requires in an organick part ſtrictly ſo taken, hence it comes to paſſe the Phyſitians, for the moſt part, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe an organick to a ſimilar.</p>
                     <p>But the conſtitution of ſimilar parts,
<note place="margin">The conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milar parts milar parts</note> even as of thoſe which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt of Elements, and other mixed bodies, conſiſts in the lawful mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the four primary qualities.</p>
                     <p>But beſides that temperature of primary qualities,
<note place="margin">Occult qualities.</note> other quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties alſo are in them which are more occult, ariſing from their forms, which parts all of them poſſeſſe, as is manifeſt by their ſympathy and antipathy with other natural bodies, and by ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral actions, and kinds and manners of actions, which are beyond the force of Elements.</p>
                     <p>The natural conſtitution of organick parts,
<note place="margin">The conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of diſſimilar parts.</note> conſiſts in a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition fit to perform actions; namely in number, magnitude, conformation, compoſition or ſcituation.</p>
                     <p>There is a common unity in them both, as well ſimilar as diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milar and organick: for not onely the whole body, but every part thereof, whether ſimilar or organick, ought to be whole and entire. And if our bodies obtain theſe three things, it is ſound, if either be wanting, it becomes ſick.</p>
                     <p>Yet, there is a certain latitude of health,
<note place="margin">The lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of health.</note> nor do all men acquire the ſame perfection of performing actions; but in regard of age, ſex, and other circumſtances, ſome do perform all or certain actions better then others, yet all of them nevertheleſſe are ſound; but Phyſitians call all thoſe that deviate from perfect health,
<note place="margin">Whether there be a Neutral diſpoſition.</note> and yet are not ſick, Neuters; and place a neutral conſtitution, as it were, in the middle betwixt the ſick and well. For although, if we rightly weigh the matter, there is no ſuch thing as middle diſpoſition, differing from health and a diſeaſe, and every man is either ſick or well; yet Phyſitians conſider Neuters, not as the mean betwixt ſick and wel; but as differing from perfect health peculiarly, and diſtinguiſh Neu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters from thoſe that are ſound, not as differing in kind, but in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of more or leſſe.</p>

                     </head>
                     <p>BUT that the nature of health may be the more manifeſt, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſhall be ſpoken particularly of this three-fold conſtitution of a body which is neceſſary to health;
<note place="margin">What a Tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is.</note> and firſt, for what belongs to the conſtitution of ſimilar parts, as they are ſuch, that is a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perament, which is a quality ariſen from the mutual action and paſſion of primary qualities, and reſulting out of them ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and joyned together. But not the form it ſelf of a mixt ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance; ſithence it is ſubject to the ſenſes, acquired by change (or motion) ſubject to alteration, and hath its riſe from the primary qualities; Nor is it onely a harmony (although there be a certain proportion of qualities in a Temperament) ſince it is the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate inſtrument of actions, which doth not belong to a bare pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion which is an accident.</p>
                     <p>But from the Temperament,
<note place="margin">A Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rament of a mixt body two-fold.</note> things are ſaid to be temperate or intemperate; and indeed, any thing is ſaid to be temperate two wayes, either ſimply and abſolutely, and in its own kind, or in relation to ſome other; for if there be that proportion of qualities, that they wholly concur in equal ſtrength, ſuch a Temperament is ſaid to be ſimply and abſolutely ſuch, and ſuch a Temperament is commonly called a Temperament <hi>ad pondus,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">To weight.</note> or according to weight, (as if it were weighed in a ballance) and is of an Arithmetical pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion; But if there be a certain inequality of qualities in relation to their ſtrength,
<note place="margin">To Justice.</note> it is called a Temperament to Juſtice, and this is called a Geometrical proportion; although, if you ſtrictly regard the proportion of the qualities amongſt themſelves, it is then an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperament, not a Temperament.</p>
                     <p>Now this Temperament (as we call it) wherein there is not an equality of primary qualities, takes its denomination from that quality, which doth exceed the reſt, whether it be one or two. And the action which proceeds from the Temperament, is aſcribed to the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity that doth predominate; although the reſt are no wayes to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded from having a ſhare in the action.</p>
                     <p>Of theſe Temperaments ſome are ſimple,
<note place="margin">Temper te to Juſtice two-ſold. Simple.</note> others compound; Simple, is when one quality onely exceeds its contrary, and thereſt are equal, whereof there are four kinds, according to the number of the primary qualities; Hot, wherein heat doth rule over cold the moiſture and drowth being equal; Cold, where cold overcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth the heat, but the moiſture and drineſs are equal; Moiſt, wherein moiſture exceeds drineſſe, the heat and cold being equal; Drineſſe,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:36866:13"/>wherein drowth dryes up moiſture, the heat and cold as before being equal.</p>
                     <p>But when two qualities exceed their contraries there ariſeth a compound Temperament:
<note place="margin">Compound. The latitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de of Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perament.</note> whereof there are likewiſe four kinds ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the combinations, (as far as poſſibly they may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bine) of the four primary qualities: to wit, Hot and Moiſt, Hot and Dry, Cold and Moiſt, Cold and Dry. In every one of theſe there is a great latitude, and in the ſimple Temperament ſome have more, ſome leſſe of heat or cold by much then other. In compound Temperaments ſome one, ſometimes both qualities, exceed the reſt in an extraordinary, yet different manner.</p>
                     <p>Any thing is ſaid to be Hot, Cold, Moiſt, or Dry,
<note place="margin">How many wayes any thing is ſaid to be hot, moiſt cold, and dry.</note> not only ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply regard being had to the univerſal nature of mixt bodies, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in if you conſider a middle ſort of body exceeding in neither, and in reſpect of this you accompt all others that differ from it Intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate, and from the quality excelling is called, Hot, Cold, Moiſt or Dry; but beſides this, there is made a compariſon to three: Firſt, the compariſon is made to the next Genus, or kind in nature, as if in the whole ſort of living Creatures, you appoint one living Creature to be temperate, all others in reſpect of that, are called intemperate; Secondly, a compariſon is made with a middle ſort of the ſame kind, ſo a Boy is ſaid to be hot, an old man cold; Thirdly, reſpect is had to every individual, that ſo this compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to that as being Hotter, is Cold, but compared to a colder is hot.</p>
                     <p>Man, for whoſe ſake theſe things of Temperaments are ſpoken,
<note place="margin">In man there is a twofold Tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> ſince his body is not ſimply mixed but organick and living, there is required in him a double Temperament, one of the body, as it is abſolutely and ſimply mixt; The other as it is living. This is loſt by death, and is often changed by old age; but that remaineth ſometimes in the dead carcaſs after death; yet at length by putre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction and corruption of that which is mixed tis diſſolved. In that alſo, according to Heat, Cold, Drowth and Moiſture, there is a great diverſity of parts. But the matter which is proper to living Creatures in all, is Heat and Moiſture.</p>
                     <p>Again the Temperament of a living man is twofold,
<note place="margin">Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rament, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluent.</note> the one Innate, the other Influent. Innate, is that which is imbibed in the living parts of man, &amp; by reaſon of the Innate heat is inherent in him from his firſt being. Influent, is that which floweth from the principal parts, and is communicated to the whole body. And that it is not the ſame with Innate, is manifeſt from thoſe that fall into a Swoun; when the body becomes extreme cold, and yet the Innate Temperament is not changed. Theſe three Temperaments though
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:36866:14"/>they may be conſidered ſeverally: Yet they concur to conſtitute one Temperament of a ſound man. And, therefore although with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all doubt, amongſt all other living Creatures man is of the moſt temperate, ſo that other living Creatures, as alſo me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines compared to him, are ſaid to be Hotter, Colder, Moiſter, or Dryer;</p>
                     <p>Yet ſimply and abſolutely he is not temperate;
<note place="margin">The Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perament of a man, of what ſort it is.</note> for common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſense tels us, that Heat in man is predominate over the other qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities; for the Temperature of a man to perform his actions beſt is Hot and Moiſt, and our lives conſiſt of Heat and Moiſture: on the contrary, coldneſs and drineſs lead us to death, and by how much ſooner a man is cooled and dryed, by ſo much ſooner he grows old and dyes.</p>
                     <p>Yet,
<note place="margin">The diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences of the Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raments of man.</note> that heat and that moiſture have their degrees. For if the heat exceed the cold and the moiſture the drowth moderately, that Temper is beſt and is accompted Temperate. All others differing from this are called either Hot and Moiſt, Hot and Dry, Cold and Moiſt, or Cold and Dry; although all in general are Hot and Moiſt.</p>
                     <p>Theſe differences of Temperaments are commonly explained by the names of Sanguine,
<note place="margin">Sanguine, Cholerick, Phlegma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy.</note> Cholerick, Phlegmatick and Melancholy Temperaments. Theſe differences and appellations may be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of, if they are not taken from the diverſity of excrementitious humours, in various bodies; but from the variety of blood, which is the nutriment of the body.</p>
                     <p>For thoſe whoſe Blood is temperate,
<note place="margin">Occult qualities.</note> or moderately hot and moiſt, are called Sanguines: Thoſe who have hotter and dryer blood, and their bodies from thence become hotter and dryer, are called Cholerick Perſons: Thoſe who have colder and moiſter, and their bodies from thence grows colder and moiſter, are called Phlegmaticks: Thoſe who have cold and dry blood, and their bodies from thence become cold and dry, are Melancholians.</p>
                     <p>But we muſt not reſt at the Primary qualities; for there are others more noble and more abſtruſe, the cauſes of many actions, and of Sympathy, and Antipathy, with other alterations that muſt be granted; although in this humane imbecillity, for the moſt part, they are unknown to us.</p>
                     <p>The Aſtrologers,
<note place="margin">The opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of the Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logers.</note> that they may ſome way expreſſe the various Conſtitutions of Bodies, according to the occult diverſities of Stars, call ſome Solar bodies, born under the influence of the Sun; ſo Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vial under <hi>Jupiter;</hi> others Martial, Venereal, Mercurial, Saturni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, as being born under one of thoſe; and alſo admit of mixt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions born under ſeveral Planets; nor indeed abſurdly altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:36866:14"/>ſince there is a great agreement and conſent betwixt Superior and Inferior bodies.</p>
                     <p>But ſince there are divers parts of a body, and each part hath its peculiar Temperature, not onely proceeding from the mixture of Elements; but ſome are hotter, ſome have leſſe heat in them; nevertheleſſe they agree together, to make the Temperament of the whole, which is hot and moiſt; and ſo heat with cold, moiſture with dry things are equal'd. So that from thence there proceedeth a certain Harmony, and the Temperament of the whole, is mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately hot and moiſt.</p>
                     <p>But to conſtitute that Temperament of the whole,
<note place="margin">The Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perament of the whole wherein it depends.</note> the noble parts of the body perform more then the reſt, and moſt eſpecially the Heart, the Fountain and Treaſury of the native heat, and vital ſpirits. From whence all the parts of the body receive the influent ſpirits and heat. Next to it the Liver, which furniſheth the whole body with aliment, namely bloud; afterwards the Stones; then the Brain, the ſhop of Animal ſpirits; laſt the Stomack, the place for the firſt Concoction.</p>
                     <p>Concerning the Temperament of ſeveral parts,
<note place="margin">The Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perament of the parts of the body. The Hot Parts.</note> the moſt Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate is the skin; eſpecially that in the Palm of the hand, to which as to the mean, the other parts being compared, tend to heat, cold, drowth or moiſture.</p>
                     <p>The Hot parts are the Heart, of all the parts the hotteſt, the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of native heat, and Cloſet of vital ſpirits. Alſo the Liver, fleſh of the Muſcles, Spleen, Reins, Lungs, Veins and Arteries, Fat alſo and fatneſs.</p>
                     <p>The Cold, are Bones, Griſtles, Ligaments, Tendons, Nerves,

                     <p>The Moiſt parts are Fat, the marrow of the bones, the Brain,

<note place="margin">Dry.</note> Arteries, Veins, hard Nerves.</p>
                     <p>There is a certain difference of Temperaments in mans body by reaſon of Sex and Age: As for what belongeth to Sex,
<note place="margin">The Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perament of Sex.</note> Females are colder then Males, as having contracted a colder nature from their principles of generation, leſt that the blood neceſſary for future ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration by a ſtronger heat ſhould be conſumed.</p>
                     <p>The Temperament is alſo changed according to age; to wit,
<note place="margin">The Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perament of ages.</note> the age which is principally ordained for certain internal changes by heat and moiſture. Authors for the moſt part divide mans life into three ages, Child-hood, Manly-age, and Old-age; or Youthful,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:36866:15"/>Age of perfection, Declination; or if you pleaſe, into the firſt, middle, and laſt age; to which differences other ages, ſpoken of by Authors, may be referred.</p>
                     <p>The firſt age therefore is our Infancy, which remaineth till the ſeventh year; the ſecond our Child-hood, which for the moſt part continueth to the fourteenth year of our age: then our youth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full age from the fourteenth to the five and twentieth, when our growth for the moſt part in ſtature ceaſeth. And ſometime <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrates</hi> in his firſt Book of Aphoriſms and fourteenth chap. ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compts theſe ages before mentioned, ages of growth. From thence to the five and thirtieth is our manly of flouriſhing age; from thence to the forty eighth year is our prime or moſt principal age, then begins old age; which hath its degrees alſo, for each age hath its Temperament, Infants and Boys are hot and moiſt; youthful age is moſt Temperate, and obtains the moſt convenient temper for humane actions; the flouriſhing manly age, or prime Viril age is hot and dry; laſtly old age by reaſon of the waſting of the Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dical moiſture, and defect of the promigenial Innate heat is cold and dry; and by how much the older, by ſo much the colder and dryer.</p>

Nor by heat and moiſture do we underſtand the bare quality, but the quality, with the Subject; to wit, a body hot and moiſt; the matter namely or Subject wherein heat is, and the quality from whoſe predominancy the Subject hath its name; to wit, the moſt pure, ſubtile, and hotteſt portion of the ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milar parts, and eſpecially of the Spermatick parts. This heat is otherwiſe called both by Phyſicians and Philoſophers, by the name of the within ſeated ſpirit, or the native ſpirit; and it is more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniently called, the within ſeated ſpirit, then the innate heat. For although in all the ſubſtance be hot;

                     <p>Concerning the nature and original of the innate ſpirit and heat,
<note place="margin">Of the original and nature of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate heat.</note> there is a great controverſy amongſt Phyſitians and Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, and 'tis diſputable, whether it be Elementary, or of another nature; And although in ſuch an obſcure thing, ſince very learned men diſagree, it be very hard to determine any thing, yet I think theirs to be the more probable opinion, who conſent with <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> in his ſecond Book of Generation of living Creatures, and third Chapter; That Innate heat is not Elementary, nor hath its original from fire or other Elements; nor yet is it of a Heavenly na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but proportionable to the ſtability of Stars. For eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſpecifical form requires its peculiar domicil and proper ſubject, and the more noble form requires the more noble habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and a more Divine power then Elementary, requires a more noble manfion then a body that is compoſed of Elements.</p>
                     <p>Moreover, more noble actions,
<note place="margin">The ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſect of the Innate heat.</note> and Sympathy and Antipathy are in it, which purely from Elements cannot proceed; &amp; again this Innate heat and inborn Spirit, in many Plants is preſerved in winter time, and in the midſt of froſts ſafe and ſecure; Moreover this Innate heat, and radical moiſture is founded in the parts which are faſhioned in the firſt generation of an embryon; but the greateſt plenty of it is in the heart, which from thence is called by <hi>Galen,</hi> the fire-fewel of the Innate heat.</p>
                     <p>This inborn heat, is the chiefeſt inſtrument of the ſoul,
<note place="margin">The uſe of the Innate heat.</note> by which it perfects, undergoes all the actions of life and whatſoever healthy thing in us, and profitable in generation, in nutriment, or in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſion of a diſeaſe, is performed by that. From this benefit and excellency of Innate heat,
<note place="margin">The In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate ſoul is not a ſoul.</note> ſome have taken it and the Soul for the ſame thing, and have called it the Eſſence of the vital faculty; the faculty governing us, the ſubſtance of the ſoul, and the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of all our actions; but ſince the Innate heat is neither the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:36866:16"/>ſoul, nor the chief cauſe of our actions, it is onely the chief in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument in performing the actions of the ſoul, in operation, which is not corporal.</p>
                     <p>This Innate heat doth not remain alwaies the ſame,
<note place="margin">The chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of the innate heat</note> but is chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in the courſe of our age. For at our firſt coming into th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>mal faculties may be called Natural;) The Natural faculty by the Philoſophers, is called a growing or flouriſhing power. All its actions tend to the preſervation of its kind, or elſe of the Indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duals of its ſpecies. Now to the preſervation of its individuals be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs Nutrition, and Augmentation, to the preſervation of its kind Generation belongs.</p>
                     <p>The nouriſhing faculty whoſe action is called Nutrition,
<note place="margin">Nutri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration.</note> is that which turneth aliment into the ſubſtance of the body living, and reſtores what is taken away, and performs this work during all ones life time.</p>
                     <p>The faculty increaſing whoſe action is called Augmentation is,
<note place="margin">Augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</note> that which extendeth the body to its due and juſt bigneſs, whoſe office is moſt performed in our growing age, and is extended till it compleateth and perfecteth its due magnitude.</p>
                     <p>The generating faculty whoſe action is called Generation is,
<note place="margin">Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> that by which man by his kind continues to perpetuity, which by Individuals cannot be done.</p>
                     <p>And theſe three faculties being as it were the Princes,
<note place="margin">The ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, Attra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, Concocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Expul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</note> have others as it were their ſervants added to them; The Attractive, the Retentive, the Alterative or Digeſtive, the Expulſive.</p>
                     <p>The Attractive draweth profitable nouriſhment to the parts; The Retentive, reteins it ſo long there till it be digeſted. The Digeſtive altereth aliment, changeth it, &amp; renders it fitting for that which is living. The Expulſive faculty rejects that as excrementi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, which is dull and unfit to be converted into the ſubſtance of the body.</p>
                     <pb n="16" facs="tcp:36866:18"/>
                     <p>The Attractive, Retentive, and Expulſive faculties perform their actions principally by the benefit of the fibers. Attraction is made by the right fibers placed along the length of a member; Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention by the oblique or flanting fibers; Expulſion by thoſe that paſſe overthwart; but Digeſtion or Concoction are performed by the Heat of the member. But in the other parts of the body, the ſame faculties want not the help of the fibers, but perform their operations only by the help of the Innate heat which is in each part.</p>
                     <p>But although aliment in nouriſhing be in a capacity to be like to the body yet actually it is unlike at the firſt; and therefore is changed by little and little untill it be rendered like to that into whoſe ſubſtance it is to be turned, which is performed by ſeveral Concoctions.</p>
                     <p>Concoction is either private,
<note place="margin">One Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction is publick, another pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate.</note> and is appointed onely for nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment and uſe of the part where it is made; or publick, which is made for the common uſe of the whole body. That is made in the ſeveral parts: this in the Stomack, Liver, and Spleen. Hence there is commonly accompted three Concoctions neceſſary for nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment of the body: The firſt is that which is made in the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack, the ſecond in the Liver, from which that of the Spleen is not to be excluded; the third in the ſeveral parts of the body. There are other actions which paſſe through the Fabrick of the whole bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, ſuch as that of the Vital ſpirits in the Heart, the Animal in the Brain, and that of milk in the Duggs, the generation of ſeed in the Stones, unleſs you will refer this to the Generative faculty; not by reaſon of the part wherein it is generated, but by reaſon of the end for which it was inſtituted (namely) publick uſe.</p>
                     <p>The firſt Concoction is made in the Stomack,
<note place="margin">The firſt Concoction is made in the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack.</note> which firſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares Nutriment for the whole body: To which for this reaſon, not onely the power of Concoction, but alſo a double Appetite is given; Natural, by which it deſires nouriſhment neceſſary for it ſelf; Animal, by which it requires nutriment for the whole body. The Natural Appetite doth not ſenſibly want nutriment;
<note place="margin">Appetite two-fold. Natural. Animal.</note> but as the other part by a natural inſtinct requires and draws nutriment. But the Animal Appetite hath an exquiſite ſenſe joyned to this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, living in the upper Orifice of the Stomack, by which it can perceive not onely its own wants, but the wants of all the body beſides. For after the whole body is emptied, it draws out of the Veins, and the Veins which require to be filled again, ſuck up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward again from the Stomack, and their ſucking is again re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in the Orifice of the Stomack,

And ſo Urine is properly called an excrement of the ſecond concoction, to wit, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the ſerous part of Urine is ſeparated from blood, and mixed with potulent matter, affords Urine.</p>
                     <p>Blood thus ſeparated and cleanſed from its excrements,
<note place="margin">The parts of the maſſe of blood.</note> neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs is ſaid to contein in it ſelf many humours; Nor is that maſſe of blood ſo elabourated and wrought in the Liver, and conteined in the Hollow Vein plainly Homogeneal or of the ſame kind, but ſome parts in it are Temperate, others colder, others hotter, others dryer, others moiſter; The moſt Temperate in its kind is called blood, the hotter and dryer part by reaſon of its conſanguinity with choler
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:36866:19"/>is called Cholerick blood, the colder and moiſter is called Pitui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous blood, the colder and dryer is called Melancholy blood. Yet all theſe parts of blood are conteined under the form or eſſence of blood, and are profitable for the nouriſhment of the body. Nor do the humors in a ſound body conſtitute a maſſe of excrementitious blood, neither in the Veins of a man moſt healthy are theſe humors Choller, Phlegme, Melancholy, acounted excrements.</p>
                     <p>Hence ariſeth the deciſion of the queſtion, whether our body's be nouriſhed by blood only, or by the four humors; For when <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> Tays that animals that have blood in them are nouriſhed by blood only, he intended the whole maſſe of blood; but Phyſitians when they ſay that our bodies are nouriſhed, not only by blood but by other humors, by blood they underſtand the moſt temperate part of blood, or one part of the maſſe of blood, and this they would have, that not only that part, but the reſt of the maſſe, to be profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table for the nouriſhment of the body. But that our bodies are nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed by excrementitious humors, no man in his wits ever ſaid.

                     </p>
                     <p>The blood being perfected in the Liver, is diſtributed through the branches of the Hollow Vein over the whole body, to nouriſh it and all its parts: That change by which it is aſſimilated to other parts, is called the third concoction, which is performed by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate heat, in each part.
<note place="margin">Four ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condary hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors.</note> In this concoction the blood before it aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milates the parts, receives ſome external diſpoſitions, and is chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged into four humors called ſecondary humors. The firſt is called Innominate, or without a name,
<note place="margin">The firſt In nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate.</note> when the blood paſſeth through the capillar Veins, and admits of a ſenſible mutation by reaſon of the heat of the external parts, and in the Spermatick parts turns white, in the fleſhy parts remains red. 2 The ſecond is Dew,
<note place="margin">The ſecond Dew.</note> namely that blood which paſſeth without the orifice of the Veins. 3 The third is called Glue,

                     <p>This third concoction hath alſo its excrements; one thick, to wit filthineſs in the skin, which is collected in the garments, alſo in the brain, eyes, and ears; the other thin, which is diſſolved by inſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble tranſpiration, ſometimes alſo it is evacuated by ſweat. For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though all things are rightly performed in the body, and the nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment be well concocted, and moreover nothing external and violent befal the body, as Baths, Heat, Violent exerciſes, no ſweat paſſe through the skin in the night; yet becauſe even in the moſt healthy all things are not ever exactly performed, and many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viate from their beſt condition as to health, and moreover many

                     <p>Another office of the natural function is Augmentation or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing,

                     <p>There are two principles which concur to the Generation of a Child, the ſeed of the male and female, and the menſtruous blood.
<note place="margin">The Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of generation.

<note place="margin">Blood.</note> although the power and force be greater in the male then the female. But the menſtruous blood is only the material prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple; wherefore it is ordered by the Creator, that at the time when ſemales are apt and fit for procreation; which for the moſt part is from the fourteenth till the five and fortieth year of their age, that blood which the other parts wants not, each month is ſent to the womb to ſupply what may be wanting for a little one, or if the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male be not great, may be by it evacuated.
<note place="margin">Menſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous blood.</note> This menſtruous blood of it ſelf is not offenſive, nor is it expelled becauſe it is hurtful, but becauſe it aboundeth in quantity; but when it becomes pernicious, 'tis by reaſon of its remaining too long in the body &amp; by its comix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture with other humours.</p>
                     <p>The forming of the young is cauſed by the Soul,
<note place="margin">The forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the young.</note> which is in the ſeed, and there ſhews it ſelf in two actions, in putting life into the conception, and forming of all the parts: and the Soul, as <hi>Scali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger</hi> writeth out of <hi>Themiſtius,</hi> is its own architect, which builds a convenient domicill for its own habitation; But it receiveth this power from the Creator, whoſe Inſtruments and hands as it were the Souls are, and he hath given this energy to them at the Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of them, then which nothing can be more wonderful to be thought on.</p>
                     <p>The Generative faculty, hath two others whereby it performs its Office; The Alterative and Formative.
<note place="margin">The Alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative. The For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mative.</note> The Alterative is that which changeth the generative matter into the ſubſtance of the young, and all its parts; the formative is that which Forms all the members and gives them their quantity, figure, number, place, and the reſt. The Inſtrument, which the Soul and formative power uſeth, is the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mative

<note place="margin">Concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> and then begins a ſending forth of the inſtruments of the body to be made, &amp; then is it called a Conception, which commonly is ſaid to continue til the ſeventh day.</p>

Theſe two coats in the birth ſeem to be one as it were, and come forth after the Child, and are therefore called the Afferbirth.</p>
                     <p>But the ſolid and Spermatick parts ſhall be explained in the firſt place, and afterwards according to their nobleneſs, and as neceſſity requires, the reſt ſhall be perfectly ſhewn.</p>
                     <p>The Infant in the womb doth not take that nouriſhment, which it receiveth by the mouth, but from the Mother, for the receiving whereof there are appointed by nature four veſſels belonging to the Navel; namely a Vein which is a branch which comes from the Gate-vein, which is as it were the infants nurſe, two Arteries branches ariſen from the Iliak Vein, by which the Infant breaths (although later Authors, who teach us that the vital Spirits by which the Child breaths proceed not from the Mother, but from the Childs own heart, do aſſign another uſe to the ſaid Iliak branches; to wit, that the Vital Spirits ſhould be carried from the heart of the Child to the exterior parts thereof, namely the Secondines) and the Urine-paſſage which is carried from the bottom of the bladder unto the Navel.</p>
                     <p>The time from the conception to the bringing forth, Phyſitians divide into two parts; the firſt is called the time of formation, from the conception till the time when firſt the Child begins to move; the ſecond the time of adorning, which is the time from its motion till its coming forth.
<note place="margin">Of adorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</note>

<note place="margin">The time of birth.</note> it is nine months end or the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the tenth month, that a natural birth happens: for the moſt part ſuch Children as live come into the World at that time, and that time for humane birth is moſt natural. But before half a years time experience tells us, that a Child can hardly be brought forth and live; and if it ſo happen that before the ſcaventh month be ended, a Child be borne and live, it is a great rarity and very ſtrange. But in the ſeaventh month becauſe the perfection is finiſhed of all the parts, the Child may live, and eſpecially, which, as <hi>Hippocrates</hi> in his book of beginnings ſays, is of two hundred and ten dayes, that is, about the end of the ſeaventh month brought forth. But <hi>Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi> ſays that a Child borne in the eighth month cannot live. Yet others ſay, that ſome that are borne in the eighth month may live. After the tenth month, the Child being great wants nouriſhment and roome to be in, although we read ſome are delivered after the tenth month, yet that is ſeldome.
<note place="margin">The time of legiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate birth.</note> For a legitimate birth (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Law of Nature) is then when there is not roome enough for the Child to live and move in, nor aliment enough to ſatisfy him, for then 'tis time to ſhake off his ſhackles thoſe tunicles, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to make away for its own birth, and the Mother finds paines, and the womb ſtrives to put out that bagg, and by its expul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive faculty ſends forth the young, which thing the Voluntary endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of the mother much helpeth, which is done by her contracting her Spirits, and depreſſion of her Midriff and ſqueeſing the muſcles of the paunch.</p>

<pb n="24" facs="tcp:36866:22"/>Spirits, but by its own proper Spirits, which from thence are called Vital Spirits, it is deſervedly to be eſteemed a peculiar faculty, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                     <p>There are three ſorts of Vital faculties,
<note place="margin">Its actions are three.</note> and ſo many motions of the heart wherein they relide. The firſt is the generation of the Vital Spirit and heat; The ſecond is the Pulſe; The third is the Iraſcible faculty.</p>

<note place="margin">Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Vital Spirits. A Pulſe. Its defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition. Of Dila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting. Of Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting.</note> is the generation of the Vital Spirits, and influent heat; The ſecond, without the which the firſt cannot perform its office is the Pulſe, namely the motion of the heart and of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries, conſiſting in dilating and contracting, that ſo the Vital Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits may be generated and diſtributed, and the natural heat may be preſerved in its natural harmony: By Dilatation the heart is filled, and attracts to its ſelf air, with blood from the right Ventricle, by the Venous Artery (which goes from thence to the heart) and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts from the lungs air and blood by help of the Arterial Vein into the left Ventricle of the heart; for the generation and refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and reſtauration of the Vital Spirits and heat. By the Syſtole or Contraction of the Heart, it diſtributeth the Vital Spirits and Arterious blood through and by the help of the great Artery into the whole body, and ſends the fuliginous excrements to the Lungs by the Arterial Vein. In like manner the Dilatation of the Artery through its little Orifices, terminating in the skin, attracts to it ſelf ambient air to form and cool its heat; the Orifices that are termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated neer the Heart, draw from it the hotteſt and thinneſt blood, full of Vital Spirit; But as the mouths of the Arteries with the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices of the Veins, do draw the pureſt and fineſt Spirits to foſtet and cheriſh their heat, but by Contraction they exp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>In the third place the Iraſcible faculty belongeth to the Vital faculty,

And that its reſidence is in the Heart is moſt evident, becauſe the motion of the Heart and the Pulſe of the Arteries are moſt evidently changed in the paſſions of the mind.</p>
                     <p>Reſpiration is alſo added to the Vital faculty as principally ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to further its action,

                     <p>THE Internal Senſes are thoſe,
<note place="margin">The Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Senſes are three.</note> that are converſant about ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibles revealed by the external ſenſes; and they are three, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the diverſity of their functions and operations, which are adminiſtred by them; The Common ſenſe, the Phantaſie and the Memory.</p>
                     <p>The common ſenſe is an internal ſenſe,

                        </gap>aſie.</p>
                     <p>The Phantaſie is an Internal ſenſe,
<note place="margin">The Phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſie.</note> which conſidereth more dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently, and longer retaineth the ſenſible Species received from the common-ſenſe, and thoſe Species that are formed by it ſelf.</p>
                     <p>The Memory is that which receiveth and retaineth the ſenſible Species, which are known by the Phantaſie,
<note place="margin">The Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory.</note> and when occaſion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth exhibits and brings them forth again. But there are two acts of the memory, the one is called by the name of the faculty of the memory, the other is Reminiſcence. The memory is a prompt apprehenſion or repetition of any thing heretofore known and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, as it was perceived and repeated and that readily.
<note place="margin">Remini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcence.</note> Remini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcence is that which out of the remembrance of one or more things ſpoken of, by regreſſion comes to remember that, which before could not come readily into the mind.</p>
                     <p>The principle and immediate Inſtrument of all the internal ſenſes, and of all principal actions is the brain, which other things ſhew, but this eſpecially; That if that be hurt theſe actions are hurt, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that in curing theſe, the remedies muſt be applyed to the brain.</p>
                     <p>Now all theſe action are performed in the ſubſtance of the brain, nor are thoſe faculties diſtinguiſhed by their ſeats or places in the brain, neither are their diſtinct operations performed in diſtinct places of the brain. For there is not ſufficient reaſon given why the common ſenſe ſhould be ſeated in the former part of the brain: for although it be the Center where all the external ſenſes meet and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur; yet the Nerves that are ſubſervient to the external ſenſes, take not their beginning from the fore moſt part of the brain. So no evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent reaſon can appear to perſwade why the Memory ſhould be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from the Phantaſie, and by conſequence from the reaſonable faculty; and why the Phantaſie in the former, the Rational in the middle, and the Memory in the hinder part of the brain ſhould be
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:36866:24"/>placed; for the Imagination and Memory are converſant about the ſame things though after a different manner; But although often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times one of theſe faculties being offended the others remain un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prejudiced, as oftentimes the Memory is loſt, the imagination, and rational faculties not hurt, and on the other ſide the apprehenſion and ratiocination offended, and the Memory ſound and perfect; yet that cometh not ſo much to paſſe through the diverſaty of organs, parts of the brain from whence thoſe actions ariſe, as by the change of their proper diſpoſitions, and of thoſe things which are required to perform thoſe actions.</p>
                     <p>The affections of thoſe ſenſes hitherto explained are ſleep and watchfulneſs.
<note place="margin">The af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of the ſenſes are two. Sleep.</note> Sleep is a ceſſation of the natural and commonſenſe, &amp; of the external ſenſes ordained for the health of living Creatures, by detaining of the Animal Spirits in the brain, &amp; hindering them from flowing to the Inſtruments of ſenſe and motion. The cauſes that bring it to paſſe that the Animal Spirits flying into the brain, are there detained, and are as it were ſmitten and ceaſe, are ſeveral, whereof ſome perform it by taking them away, as watching, labour and other things in the like nature; or by rendring them leſſe moveable and, benumm'd, or as others conceive by penning in, and ſtopping their way as vapours aſcending after taking of meat and drink, or as it were pleaſingly and contentedly ſtopping, inviting from motion to reſt, which ſweet melodies, murmuring ſtreams, gentle rocking and the like occaſion; The end of ſleep is the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhing and ſtrengthning of the Spirits and external ſenſes, by taking away their motions and operations, and from hence comes a reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of their ſtrength and vigour.</p>
                     <p>Watchfulneſs is oppoſed to ſleep,
<note place="margin">Watching.</note> and it is nothing elſe but the efficacy or force of ſenſe, or ſolution rather of the ſenſes, proceeding from the hinderance of the free flowing of the Animal Spirits into all the members of the body. Man waketh or is ſtirred up out of his ſleep after a two-fold manner; Either of his own accord, when con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction is performed, the vapours that hindred the Spirits coming forth are diſcuſſed and ſeparated, or ſharp vapours are carried to the brain and trouble the Amimal Spirits, that they cannot freely flow into the inſtruments of the ſenſes; or by an external cauſe, when from a more violent external cauſe, as Clamour, or touch, the ſenſitive faculty being ſtirred up converts its ſelf to perceive. Nor do the organs of the ſenſes wholly want Animal Spirits in ſleep, but ſome ſtil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>And firſt for what belongs to a diſeaſe; Although as the name of health is generally attributed to all things that happen to a man ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to nature, ſo the name of a diſeaſe is given to all things that befal a man contrary to nature, and thoſe are ſaid to be morbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick: yet if we may ſpeak properly, theſe three, a Diſeaſe, the cauſe of a Diſeaſe, and Symptomes, as they differ in the thing, ſo they may be diſcerned by their names alſo.</p>
                        <p>But whereas a diſeaſe is conrrary to nature;
<note place="margin">The formal reaſon of a diſeaſe.</note> but health is that power of acting which is to be performed according to nature: a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe is an impotency of performing natural actions; and as thoſe who are apt to do thoſe things which are according to nature, are ſaid to be ſound; ſo thoſe are deſervedly ſaid to be ſick, who are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>apt to perform thoſe actions.</p>
                        <p>Moreover the Subject of a diſeaſe, as alſo of health,
<note place="margin">The Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of a diſeaſe.</note> is only the living parts of a body, as being thoſe to which alone a power of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergoing natural actions is given; But all thoſe things which are not in the number of the living, as humors and other things, which are not able to perform natural actions in a man, cannot be the ſubject of a diſeaſe.</p>
                        <p>The cauſe of a Diſeaſe or of impotency to perform actions, is an
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:36866:26"/>ill conſtitution of the parts,

                           </note> as the cauſe of health is a right diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſame.</p>
                        <p>Hence a Diſeaſe is defined to be an impotency of the living parts of man to perform natural actions, ariſing from their conſtitution contrary to nature.</p>
                        <p>Although according to <hi>Galen</hi> alſo to be ſick, is not to be able to operate, and ſo this definition is not contrary to the ſenſe of <hi>Galen:</hi> yet that out of the definition of diſeaſes, differences, and profitable obſervations may the better be drawn, <hi>Galen</hi> retains the ſame terms of the definition, but places them otherwiſe, and in the ſecond Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the differences of Diſeaſes, defining a Diſeaſe ſaith; That a conſtitution of a vitious function contrary to nature is the cauſe thereof, and in his firſt Chapter of the differences of Symptomes calls it a diſpoſition contrary to nature, by which action is hurt. Namely as health is a certain quality, or harmony in the qualities in magnitude, number, figure, and other things neceſlary for the conſtitution of each part, by reaſon whereof the body is diſpoſed, and made fit to perform natural actions. So a Diſeaſe is ſuch a qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity by reaſon of which the ſame body is rendred unfit to perform the ſame actions.
<note place="margin">Diatheſis <hi>what it is.</hi>
                           </note> For the word <hi>Diatheſis</hi> taken generally ſignifies every quality according to which a man is well and ill diſpoſed, whether it be eaſily or difficultly taken away. And therefore as certain later Phyſicians will have it,
<note place="margin">A Diſeaſe is not only a privati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> a Diſeaſe is not ſimply the want of health, and nothing poſitive, but ſuch a want as proceedeth from a diſpoſition contrary to that diſpoſition, on which health de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends, which is wholly ſomething poſitive, and when a part is wounded or diminiſhed, a quality and diſpoſition is brought into it contrary to that which was preſent there before in time of health: as a hand that is wounded, is otherwiſe difpoſed then that which is well, and that which hath four fingers, otherwiſe then that which hath five. In brief; a Diſeaſe conſiſteth not only in privation of a good conſtitution, but in a contrary and vitious conſtitution.</p>

But becauſe as 'tis ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, there is one natural conſtitution of the ſimilar parts, as they

                        <p>Firſt therefore,
<note place="margin">Diſeaſes of the ſimilar parts.</note> the proper Diſeaſes of the ſimilar parts are Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes of Intemperature, when that due proportion of the primary qualities is not obſerved, but when one doth excell the other three, or two overrule the other two, contrary to nature.</p>
                        <p>Moreover there are found in ſimilar parts Diſeaſes of hidden qualities, or of the whole ſubſtance, as they call them; when there is not only in the conſtitution of the ſimilar parts, a due con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruity of the primary qualities, but a certain diſpoſition alſo of the occult qualities is requiſite.</p>

<note place="margin">Diſeaſes of Organick parts.</note> there are ſo many ſignes of Organick Diſeaſes as we have ſaid, are requiſite for the compoſition, and conſtitution of an Organ; namely four, Diſeaſes of Confirmation, of Number, Magnitude and Compoſition.</p>

<note place="margin">Diſtemper without and with matter.</note> which diſtinctions nevertheleſſe produce not new kinds but differences, which are found in many differing in kind. For firſt, one diſtemper is with matter, another without matter. Intemperature with mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is when it hath a humour joyned with it, and is cheriſhed by it; Diſtemper without matter, is that which is cheriſhed by no preter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural humour, as when heat is ſent into any part from the fire or heat of the Sun.</p>
                        <p>Moreover one diſtemper is equal, another unequal:
<note place="margin">Equal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</note> equal is that which is a little and equal in all living parts, and affects them all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:36866:27"/>
                           <note place="margin">Unequal.</note> and equally: Unequal, is that which is more intenſe in one part, and more remiſle in another, and affects one more, another leſſe. For ſince that the members of our body are conſtituted of many particles, it may come to paſſe, that all may not be equally affected by the altering cauſe, but ſome more, others leſſe, whence an unequal diſtemper ariſeth. But if the action thereof proceed ſo far, until that all are altered and affected equally, that is an equal diſtemper; Whence an unequal diſtemper is joyned with pain and trouble, as being that wherein the part is as yet to be altered; but in an equal diſtemper no pain, nor moleſtation is perceived, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that wherein the part is already altered, and the Intemperature becomes as it were familiar and domeſtick.</p>

                        <p>IT is a controverſie amongſt Phyſitians, whether there are any other.
<note place="margin">Whether there are any Diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes beſides thoſe of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</note> Diſeaſes in the ſimilar parts, beſides thoſe of Intempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Truly the ancient Phyſitians make no mention of them; but the Moderne do and principally <hi>Fernelius</hi> in Lib. 1. <hi>Pathol.</hi> Cap. 2. and Lib. 2. of the Hidden cauſes of things, Cap 9. and afterwards he largely endeavours to prove that there is yet another kind of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe beſides Intemperature in the ſimilar parts, and that is two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold: the one is of the whole ſubſtance; the other in the matter, which may be ſeen in the fore-quoted places. But 'tis not our pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe largely to reckon up the opinions of others, for this Epitome will not permit it.</p>
                        <p>But that we may briefly propound our opinion,
<note place="margin">There are Diſeaſes of hidden qua. lities. The reoſon.</note> we determine that there is another kind of Diſeaſe in the ſimilar parts, beſides Diſeaſes of Intemperature, being ſo perſwaded for theſe reaſons; firſt, becauſe every agent which acteth, deſires to make the patient like it ſelf. But there are agents from the whole ſubſtance or ſuch things, whoſe actions can be reduced into no manifeſt quality, and which are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the power of Elements, as elſewhere is proved: It neceſſarily follows that thoſe agents from the whole ſubſtance, whilſt they bring in Diſeaſes, and act in our bodies, do not change the primary, but Occult qualities, and introduce Diſeaſes agreeable, and correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to their nature. Alſo becauſe contraries may be cured and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted by their contraries: But the whole ſubſtance, or things acting in Occult qualities cure many Diſeaſes; It neceſſarily follows that their are ſuch Diſeaſes to which ſuch Medicines are oppoſed: and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe there ſhould be certain Occult Diſeaſes, in vain are Medicines
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:36866:27"/>invented which act in the whole ſubſtance. Thirdly, ſince there are actions hindred or hurt which neither can be referred to any Diſeaſe commonly known, nor to any external error, as may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in the plague and other Venemous Diſeaſes, hence we may well conclude that there are other Diſeaſes of Intemperature, from whence theſe kind of miſchiefs happen.</p>
                        <p>But which and what thoſe Diſeaſes are is likewiſe controverted. We ſetting aſide the opinions of others determine,
<note place="margin">Which are Diſeaſes of the whole ſubſtance.</note> thoſe Diſeaſes of the whole ſubſtance, or of hidden quality, to be thoſe which conſiſt in a certain occult, and malignant diſpoſition of the ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar parts, and to be no other then ſuch whoſe miſchiefs cannot be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to the primary, qualities, and ſuch as the agent cauſe excites, which is endued with a malignant, venemous and occult quality, and which are cured not by primary qualities, but by thoſe things which are ſaid to act in the whole ſubſtance.</p>
                        <p>But Diſeaſes of matter which <hi>Fernelius</hi> brings there,
<note place="margin">Whether there be ary Diſeaſes of matter.</note> are no new Diſeaſes of ſimilar parts, but either Organick Diſeaſes, as ſoftneſſe and hardneſſe in parts, wherein they ought not to be ſuch, or Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomes, or cauſes of Diſeaſes.</p>

<note place="margin">Luxation.</note> the Greeks call it <hi>Exarthroſis,</hi> when the joynts or heads of the bones go out of their hollow places or cavities.

                        <p>Another kinde of Diſeaſe of compoſition is, when the parts are ſeparated, that ought to be joyned together; which happeneth if the bonds by whoſe intervene they are linked together are looſened, made longer or broken, which happeneth ſometimes in the womb and other parts of the body; or it happens if thoſe are joyned toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that ſhould be parted a ſunder; as when one is tongue-tyed, or the eye-lids grow together, or two fingers grow together, or the fundament be cloſed.</p>

                        </head>
                        <p>THE third kind of Diſeaſe is common to ſimilar and Orga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick parts,
<note place="margin">Diſeaſes of Solution of continuity.</note> and is called Solution of Unity, when the parts which ought to be one, and continued, loſe their continuity and are divided.</p>
                        <p>There are many differences of Diſeaſes of Unity, principally taken from the part affected,
<note place="margin">Their dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences.</note> and the cauſes diſſolving Unity. Thoſe things which diſſolve Unity, ſome of them cut and prick, others erode, others bow and break, others beat in pieces. But the parts which are diſſolved are either ſoft or hard; if a ſoft part be diſſolved by a thing that cutteth,
<note place="margin">A wound.</note> it is called by the Greeks <hi>Trauma,</hi> by the Latines <hi>Vulnus, i. e.</hi> a wound.</p>
                        <p>But if a ſoft part be diſſolved by a ſharp inſtrument pricking,
<note place="margin">A pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture. Contuſion.</note> it is called a Puncture.</p>
                        <p>But if a ſoft part be offended by a blunt weapon and a hard one, and be ſtraitned within it ſelf, it is called a Confuſion, the Greek <hi>Thlaſis</hi> and <hi>Thlaſma.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>If a ſoft part be broken by any thing that bendeth it,
<note place="margin">Rupture.</note> 'tis called a Rupture, and in the nervous parts peculiarly, it is called a Spaſme.</p>
                        <p>But if there be ſolution of continuity in a hard part or bone from any other cauſe then Eroſion,
<note place="margin">Fracture.</note> namely from cutting or contuſion, it is called a fracture,
<note place="margin">Caries.</note> in Greek <hi>Agma</hi> and <hi>Catagma;</hi> but if by Ero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion it is called Caries, in Greek <hi>Teredon, i. e.</hi> rottenneſs in bones.</p>
                        <p>If continuity be diſſolved in ſoft parts by Eroſion,
<note place="margin">An Ulcer.</note> it is called <hi>Elkos</hi> in Greek, in Latin <hi>Ulcus</hi> (<hi>Anglice</hi> an Ulcer.)</p>
                        <p>Laſtly,

                        </head>
                        <p>HItherto we have ſpoken of the effential differences of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes:
<note place="margin">The acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dental differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes.</note> there remains the accidental differences, which are taken from thoſe things which follow the eſſence of a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:36866:30"/>or from the ſubject, and cauſes, and other circumſtances, and are alſo common to many.</p>
                        <p>Firſt, a body ſometimes is ſick of one diſeaſe,
<note place="margin">One diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe.</note> ſometimes of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: and that is ſaid to be one diſeaſe which onely ſeizeth on one part, and offends its actions, or when one diſeaſe afflicts the whole body; but there are many diſeaſes,
<note place="margin">Many diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes.</note> which in a different manner affect many and different parts of the body.</p>
                        <p>A diſeaſe which occupieth one part of a body, is either ſimple,
<note place="margin">A diſeaſe ſimple; compound.</note> or compound. Simple, is when no other diſeaſe is joyned with it. Compound, is when it is coupled with one, or more other diſeaſes, in the ſame part, whether they are of the ſame nature, or of ſome other; but diſeaſes which are knit together, not with other diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes, but with ſome grievous ſymptoms, are not properly called complicate diſeaſes; <hi>Fernelius</hi> calleth them diſeaſes of fellowſhip,
<note place="margin">Diſeaſes of fellowſhip. Solitary.</note> even as he calleth thoſe that are neither joyned with any other diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, nor with any grievous ſymptom Solitary diſeaſes. As for diſeaſes that are not joyned together in one part, there are many, they are divided by <hi>Fernelius</hi> into ſeparated, and implicite; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed and conſequent.</p>
                        <p>Separated are ſuch as conſiſt in divers parts,
<note place="margin">Separated.</note> which neither have common uſe, nor action, neither do they communicate the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect by turnes from one part to another: as, the Podagra, or Gout in the foot, the Ophthalmie, or Inflamed Eye.</p>
                        <p>Thoſe are called implicite diſeaſes which afflict divers parts which have one common uſe, and action,
<note place="margin">Im plicite.</note> as if divers parts of the breaſts are afflicted.</p>
                        <p>Moreover, he calleth them connexed and conſequent diſeaſes,
<note place="margin">Connexed.</note> when one diſeaſe is the cauſe of another, which principally com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to paſs when one part communicates its effects to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, from the manner of generation and ſubſiſtence,
<note place="margin">Making.</note> ſome are called diſeaſes Making, others Made.</p>
                        <p>Diſeaſes Making are ſuch,
<note place="margin">Made.</note> that although they are produced out of their cauſe, and now are; yet they cannot ſubſiſt without their efficient cauſe, but their cauſe retreating, they alſo withdraw from their ſubject.</p>
                        <p>Made diſeaſes may continue, though their efficient cauſe be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, in reſpect of the ſubject,
<note place="margin">Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall. Particular.</note> one diſeaſe is called Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall, which afflicts the whole, another particular, which affects any part of the body, another externall which occupieth the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward parts of the body; another internall which poſſeſſeth the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward parts thereof. Some diſeaſes alſo are congruous, ſuch as are
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:36866:31"/>agreeable to the Temperament and conſtitution of the body; O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers are Incongruous, and diſagreeable to the Temperament, and conſtitution thereof.
<note place="margin">Of Age.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>Fourthly, in reſpect of age, ſome are diſeaſes of Infants, others of children,
<note place="margin">Sex.</note> others of boyes, others of youths, others of young men, others of middle aged men, and others of old men: as alſo in Relation to ſex, ſome of Males, others of Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>males.</p>
                        <p>Fifthly,
<note place="margin">By the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a thing. By conſent.</note> diſeaſes ſome are by Idiopathy, or Eſſence, others by ſympathy, or conſent. A diſeaſe by eſſence is that which hath its beginning, from a cauſe begotten in that place wherein the diſeaſe is ſtirred up. By ſympathy, or conſent is that which is ſtirred up by matter ſevered from the part, where the diſeaſe is.</p>
                        <p>Sixthly,
<note place="margin">L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>giti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate. Spurious.</note> ſome diſeaſes are legitimate, others Spurious, Legiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate are ſuch as proceed from one ſimple and onely cauſe; Spuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous are ſuch as proceed from mixt humours.</p>
                        <p>Seventhly, ſome diſeaſes are inherent to man from his firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, others happen to him after he is begotten. Thoſe which come from our firſt beginning,
<note place="margin">Hereditary</note> are twofold; firſt, hereditary whoſe cauſes, and diſpoſitions are derived from the ſeed and menſtruous blood of the parents to their children; and cauſe a diſeaſe, in them which they were troubled with; ſecondly, from ill conformity ſome evill may happen to the child,
<note place="margin">Congenite.</note> from its firſt beginning, although the parents ware not troubled therewith; and therefore all diſeaſes communicated to man from his generation are not Hereditary. They ſeek a knot in a bull-ruſh, who think ſuch receſs from the naturall ſtate and condition,
<note place="margin">Whether a Congenite deformity he a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe.</note> ought not to be called a Diſeaſe, but a ſault; and they conceive that not every defect, and regreſſion from the naturall ſtate; but thoſe onely they think, ought to be called diſeaſes of defect, which are defects of perfections which they once had. But a Diſeaſe is not only a privation of perfection once had, but to be had, which agreeth to every one of the Species: and as a man is ſaid to be ſound, which hath that perfection in all the parts of the body, which ought to be in mankinde; ſo he may be ſaid to be born ſick, to whom any of thoſe perfections are wanting.</p>
                        <p>Eighthly,
<note place="margin">Contagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. Not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious. Common.</note> ſome diſeaſes are Infectious which transfuſe their ſeed, and pullution into other bodies, and affect them with the ſame diſeaſe. Not Infectious, are ſuch as cannot infect others with their venom.</p>
                        <p>Ninethly, ſome diſeaſes are ſpread, as when many diſeaſes of divers kinds invade. Some are common, wherewith many are af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected at the ſame time, with the ſame diſeaſe. Theſe again are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:36866:31"/>into Endemiall, and Epidemicall.
<note place="margin">Endemiall</note> Endemiall are (as it were) native, and genuine diſeaſes, which often frequent one place, and afflict the inhabitants of one region by reaſon of their common and domeſtick cauſe: ſuch is the Scurvy to the inhabitants of the Baltick Seas.</p>
                        <p>Epidemicall, are ſuch as infect many from one cauſe,
<note place="margin">Epidemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal. Diſeaſes of the ſeverll times of the year.</note> but not genuine to that people at the ſame time.</p>
                        <p>Tenthly, in reſpect of the time of the year, ſome are Vernall, ſome Eſtivall; ſome Autumnall, and others Hibernall, namely, ſuch as are agreeable to this or that ſeaſon of the year. In reſpect of the time of the day, ſome are called Diurnall, others Noctur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall.</p>
                        <p>In the Eleventh place, ſome diſeaſes are called great,
<note place="margin">Great.</note> others ſmall. A great diſeaſe is ſaid to be ſuch, either by its ſelf, or by accident. A diſeaſe is ſaid to be great by it ſelf three wayes; firſt,
<note place="margin">How ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold.</note> in regard of dignity, when it hurteth the organs, and inſtruments, that are moſt neceſſary for the preſervation of life, and in this ſenſe, Diſeaſes of Intemperature, amongſt Diſeaſes are of greateſt digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; Next thoſe Diſeaſes of ſolution of continuity; next to them diſeaſes of compoſition: 2. By it ſelf a diſeaſe is ſaid to be great, in reſpect of its going back from its naturall ſtate, for by how much the more it recedes from that, by ſo much is it the more ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nement: 3. It is ſaid to be great in reſpect of ill Manners, as when an ill quallity is joyned with it. By accident it is ſaid to be great, in reſpect of the beſt part which it poſſeſſeth, in which regard a diſeaſe which otherwiſe was ſmall, is ſaid to be great, as a wound in the heart, or in the brain, which in muſculous fleſh, were not dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous. 2. When it hurts the faculty that governs our body.</p>
                        <p>In the twelfth place from the manner, a diſeaſe is benigne,
<note place="margin">Benigne.</note> or maligne: Benigne is when beſides its own nature, no grievous ſymptom is joyned. Maligne,
<note place="margin">Maligne.</note> is when it hath worſe ſymptomes joyned with it, then the nature of the diſeaſe affords of it ſelf, from ſome occult qualities.</p>
                        <p>Thirteenthly, in reſpect of duration, ſome diſeaſes are ſhort,
<note place="margin">Short. Long.</note> ſome long, which ſoon terminate, or continue long, before they come to amend.</p>
                        <p>Fourteenthly, ſome are acute, others not acute,
<note place="margin">Acute. Not acute.</note> and all acute diſeaſes are ſhort, but all ſhort diſeaſes are not acute. That a diſeaſe may be ſaid to be acute, tis requiſite that it may not onely be terminated in a ſhort time, but may have ſome grievous ſymptoms joyned with it,
<note place="margin">Which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute.</note> that may ſpeedily not without danger end it in health or death; For an acute diſeaſe is that which ſwiftly with violence, and danger comes to its height. Acute diſeaſes are again
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:36866:32"/>diſtinguiſhed into very acute,
<note place="margin">How ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold.</note> ſimply acute, and ſuch as degenerate from acute. The very acute terminate by the ſeventh day; the ſimply acute end by the twentieth day; ſuch as degenerate from acute are extended beyond the twentieth, even to the fourtieth day; But all thoſe diſeaſes that are extended beyond the fourtieth day, are Diurnall, and Chronicall.</p>
                        <p>Fifteenthly,
<note place="margin">Salutary. Deadly.</note> in regard of the end, ſome diſeaſes are ſalutary, which terminate with the health of the ſick, others mortall, which deſtroy the ſick; and both either abſolutely, or <hi>ſecundum quid.</hi> Simply and abſolutely, thoſe are Salutary that terminate with the perfect health of the ſick; Mortall, are ſuch as kill the ſick; on the other ſide, ſalutary and deadly may be ſuch, <hi>ſecundum quid,</hi> when they terminate in health; but not ſound and perfect health.</p>
                        <p>Sixteenthly,
<note place="margin">Continual.</note> ſome diſeaſes are continuall, which continually afflict, and intermit not, in the whole term of their duration.</p>
                        <p>Intermitting,
<note place="margin">Intermiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive. Ordinate. Inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate.</note> are ſuch as have certain periods, and do ſometimes intermit, or ceaſe between while.</p>
                        <p>Seventeenthly, ſome are ordinate, which afflict at certain times, which the Greeks call at Periods, as Tertian, Quartan Feavers: Inordinate, are ſuch as obſerve no certain periods.</p>

<note place="margin">The times of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſes.</note> For as animals are firſt generated, thence increaſed, and come to their perfection and ſtate, and then waſte, and laſtly dye, ſo diſeaſes have their beginnings, encreaſe, vigour, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards they decline, are leſſened, and at length vaniſh.</p>
                        <p>The times of diſeaſes are two-fold,
<note place="margin">Univerſal.</note> Univerſall, and Particular. Univerſall times are ſaid to be ſuch wherein the courſe of the whole diſeaſe is included; for ſince there are diſeaſes which have certain Intervals,
<note place="margin">Particular.</note> and again new fits, or certain extentions, and remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions; Particular times are limited by the end of the fit.</p>
                        <p>The Univerſall times are four.
<note place="margin">Univerſal times how many. Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. Increaſe</note> The beginning, The augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, The ſtate, and Declination.</p>
                        <p>The beginning is that time, when the morbifique matter of the diſeaſe is yet crude, and no ſignes of concoction appear.</p>
                        <p>The augmentation is when the ſymptomes become grievous, and the ſignes of concoction begin to appear in ſuch diſeaſes, as tend to recovery of the ſick, or contrary ſigns in thoſe that are mortall.</p>
                        <p>The ſtate is when the greateſt contention is betwixt
<note place="margin">Height.</note> a diſeaſe,

                        <p>But all diſeaſes have not theſe four times, but ſuch as tend to health onely; in deadly diſeaſes, the ſick (nature being overcome) may dye either in the beginning, increaſe, or ſtate, for ſuch come not to the declination, for no man ever dyed in the declination of a diſeaſe.</p>

                        <p>Although by the Philoſophers there are rightly conſtituted four kinds of cauſes,
<note place="margin">The ſorts of cauſes.</note> the Materiall, Formall, Finall, and Efficient; yet here we are to ſpeak onely of the Efficient cauſes of diſeaſes; for the form, ſuch as accidents have, is already explained. Diſeaſes have not matter unleſs it be the ſubject wherein they are inherent;
<note place="margin">The Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitian treats of efficient cauſe. The cauſes of diſeaſes are four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold. The prox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imate. The remote</note> the end alſo is not ſince they ariſe from the want of perfection, and therefore Phyſitians when they handle the cauſe of diſeaſes under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the efficient cauſe onely.</p>

If cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes as they are referred to a diſeaſe, or its effects, they are conſidered thus; firſt, one cauſe is proximate and immediate, another remote. The proximate is that cauſe betwixt which and the diſeaſe nothing intercedes. The remote is that betwixt which and the diſeaſe there comes another neerer cauſe. The proximate (ſince nothing
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:36866:33"/>can come to paſs without a cauſe) is in all diſeaſes; but the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

<note place="margin">Whether hurt by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal meanes be Symptomes</note> they trouble themſelves exceedingly here, who endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to deduce every Symptome from a Diſeaſe, and actions hindred, which happen without a Diſeaſe, no way worthy the name of a Symptome, but think them worthy to be called certain natural differences, or imbecilities, ſince that they are accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to perform nothing beyond their own ſtrength: but they plainly erre in the matter, for that any work: may be perfected, not onely the agent, and that rightly diſpoſed, but alſo the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient which receives the operation of the agent, is required: For as in voluntary actions; as for example, in geſture, or lifting of a weight, the buſineſſe is in the free will of man, but that ſome work may be performed in the body; as for example, Sangui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, Nouriſhment. It is neceſſary that the patient be joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and coupled with the agent, but ſince the action of him that moves, and the patient moveable is but one motion, and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer onely in reaſon, as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> teacheth, in the ſecond Book of his natural Philoſophy, <hi>Chap.</hi> 3. <hi>Title</hi> 23. Diſervedly there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in natural actions, when that is not performed which ought to be, eſpecially in natural concoctions, all that which either is hurt, or fruſtrated, is deſervedly called a Symptome, whether it be done by reaſon of the agent, or of the patient; for although,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:36866:43"/>in reſpect of the agent, it be impotent. Yet ſome fault doth happen by reaſon of the patient; and therefore it is the office of a Phyſitian if he will govern a mans body aright, to govern as well the patient, as agent in ſuch actions.</p>
                           <p>A Symptome of a Symptome is that which follows another preceding Symptome,

                           <p>Moreover there is a common diviſion of Symptomes into an action hurt, errours of excretion, and retention, and qualities changed, namely ſuch as doe not hinder the actions of our bodies.</p>
                           <p>Actions hurt are of two kinds,
<note place="margin">Manner of actions hurt.</note> the one is ſo called when the faculty is hurt; The other by reaſon of ſome external fault, as is ſaid.</p>
                           <p>When the faculty is hurt, the action is ſaid to be hurt;
<note place="margin">How many ways are actions hart when the facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is hurt.</note> ſince the agent is not right, or ſince the inſtrument (for the faculties of the mind cannot be hurt) is affected contrary to nature. That the natural conſtitution of the part, which is the next inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the faculty is vitiated, which being ſpoyled, the mind cannot perform its actions. Again, ſome divide the faculty hurt into the faculty hurt alone by its ſelfe, and into certain actions hindred.

Again, to the good conſtitution of the inſtrument is required not only as aboveſaid, conſtitution of the part, as it is mixed, temperateneſſe, and innate heat, but ſpirits, and influent heat, which being deficient, the faculty cannot rightly perform its actions, as moſt plainly appears in the ſenſes.

                           <p>On the other ſide, if the agent and inſtrument are in all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects ſound, and they be well conſtituted;
<note place="margin">Through ſome exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal error.</note> yet nevertheleſſe for ſome other cauſe, which is without the conſtitution of the part, the faculty is fruſtrated in acting, and is hindred that it cannot perform its action. The action is ſaid to be hindered by ſome external error.</p>
                           <p>To external error firſt belongs the patient or object, betwixt which and the agent, there ought to be a proportion; for if
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:36866:44"/>the patient be not fit to receive the operation of the agent, a perfect action is not brought forth. Hitherto belong all theſe things by which actions are performed, or without which they cannot be performed, as time, place, and order in ſome, and moreover the uſe and neceſſity of actions.</p>
                           <p>The other two kinds of Symptomes,

                           <p>Thirdly, the fault of the retentive faculty, is when the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach cannot retain meat as it ought, or cannot retain it at all, or not long enough, when occaſion requires; or offends in all theſe: the Stomach doth not rightly retain meat, when it em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braceth it, with panting, or with twitching, or with trembling, or ſhaking. If meat be not retained, or not long enough retar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, it turneth into corruption, or is diſtributed with uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocted meat, or ejected by ordure, as in a Lyentary. If the embracing of the meat be weak, ſwimmings, or flatulencies are occaſioned.</p>
                           <p>Fourthly, the errors of concoction in the Stomach,

                           <p>Laſtly, the Symptomes of expulſion are Hiccock, mutation in the uppermoſt parts of the Stomach, whereby it ſtrives to put and caſt out that which is offenſive, and ſticks in the orifice thereof.</p>
                           <p>Diſpoſition to vomit, or loathing, or abhorring of meates is a depraved mutation in the Stomach, when it is ſtreightned in the lower part of it, and dilated in the upper, and ſtirs to caſt forth upwards what offends it, but cannot caſt it forth.</p>
                           <p>Vomiting is a depraved motion in the Stomach,

<note place="margin">A ſlow panch and ſhut. An Illiak.</note> and putteth forth nothing in a long time.</p>
                           <p>To theſe belong the Illiak, which is, when the dung, which ought to be ejected by the panch, that being cloſed, 'tis caſt out of the mouth with the meat.</p>
                           <p>For the other publike concoction,

                           <p>ANimal motion is either aboliſhed, diminiſhed,
<note place="margin">Symptomes about mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

<note place="margin">Laſſitude.</note> dryneſſe and induration of the parts ſerving for motion. It is diminiſhed in the green ſickneſs, or in lazineſſe when the motion is become weak.</p>
                           <p>It is depraved in trembling, which the Greeks cal <hi>Tremos,</hi>

                           <p>As alſo in the Convulſion,
<note place="margin">Kinds of Convulſion fits.</note> which is a preter-natural contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of a Muſcle, towards its beginning, contrary to the will; and a violent ſtretching out of the part, into which a Tendon is inſerted. A Convulſion is either Univerſal or Particular, U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſal is three-fold, <hi>Emproſthotonos, i. e.</hi> when the Neck and the reſt of the Body is bowed forward, ſo that the diſeaſed can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſet himſelfe upright. <hi>Opiſthotonos,</hi> when the body is bent backward. <hi>Tetanos,</hi> when the body is ſo ſtiff that it cannot bend any way.

<note place="margin">The cauſe of want of nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> order now requires that we may ſhew their Cauſes in the ſame order we have ſet down them; and as for the Symptomes of the Natural Faculty, amongſt them the firſt is <hi>Atrophy,</hi> or want of nouriſhment; and that is either in the whole, or in ſome part.
<note place="margin">In the whole.</note> Atrophy in the whole is occaſioned through the debility of the faculty, or default of the nouriſhment; the vertne is weakned through a
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:36866:51"/>dry diſtemper, and ſometimes hot, which principally proceeds from the Heart, labouring with the like diſtemper, as in Hek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, and other Fevers; yet ſometimes from the defect of other parts which may communicate their affects alſo with the Heart, diſeaſes may perform the ſame. Atrophy is occaſioned through defect of Aliment, when either it is not communicated in ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient quantity, or when it is affected with ſome ill quality: 'Tis wanting when too ſmall a quantity is received, or although ſufficient quantity be taken, yet 'tis not concocted through the weakneſſe of the bowels; or being concocted, 'tis not diſtributed by reaſon of the narrowneſſe of the Veines about the Liver; or it is diſperſt, or not conglutinated, by reaſon of diſtempers of the parts, eſpecially hot and dry. Atrophy is made through the pravity of nutriment, when ill blood by reaſon of the diſtemper of the bowels is generated, eſpecially hot and dry, and not ſo profitable.
<note place="margin">In part.</note> Atrophy is in ſome part whileſt its force is weak, through cold diſtemper and defect of native heat, or through want of nouriſhment, by reaſon of the ſtraitneſſe of the paſſages, by which it ſhould be communicated to the part, or occaſioned by what cauſe ſoever.</p>
                           <p>The immediate cauſe of depravation of nutrition,
<note place="margin">The cauſe of ill habit of Body.</note> and of ill habit, is vitious and raw nouriſhment in the bowels, appointed for publike concoctions, ariſing from the vitious diſpoſition there; to which ſometimes a cold and moiſt dsſtemper, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit of the body is added.</p>

                           <p>On the contrary,
<note place="margin">The cauſe of the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet ite en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed.</note> the cauſe of the encreaſe of the appetite is too much ſucking, which comes to paſſe either from ſome hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour ſticking in the ſtomach; ſuch is Melancholly, which by its ſharpneſſe and auſtereneſs binds the ſtomach, or through want of nouriſhment, which happens by reaſon of Wormes, which conſumes the Chyle, or by too much labour and exerciſe, watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, long faſtings, evacuations of blood, vomiting, or from ſome old diſtemper, binding the ſtomach.</p>
                           <p>But the appetite is depraved by a vitious humour peculiarly corrupted and fixed to the Tunicles of the ſtomach, which is either generated in the ſtomach by ill food, or elſe flowes from ſome other part, eſpecially the Womb, into the ſtomach.</p>
                           <p>Thirſt is aboliſhed, or diminiſhed, either from cold, ſweat,

                           <p>In a Coeliack the Chyle is ejected contrary to nature; and therefore the cauſe of a Lyentary is the hurting of the retentive faculty of the Ventricle and Inteſtines, by reaſon whereof the meat before it be perfectly concocted, deſcends into the Guts and is caſt out, And indeed in a Lyentary the retentive faculty of the ſtomach is principally hurt. Nor can it be that meat un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concocted can be caſt forth out of the Panch, unleſs it be ſent too ſoon into the Guts, by reaſon of ſome fault of the retentive faculty of the ſtomach; but the Coeliack is occaſioned rather by ſome hurt of the retentive faculty of the Inteſtines, becauſe Chyle generated in the ſtomach, ought to remain ſome time in the Guts; that it might there be in ſome manner elaborated, and be conveniently drawn by the meſeraik veines, and the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure ſhould be throughly elaborated: If the retentive faculty of the Inteſtines be hurt, all theſe things cannot be performed, but the Chyle untimely, and in ſome, as meaſure crude is caſt out of the Panch, but the retentive faculty of the Stomach and Guts is hurt either of its ſelfe, or by accident: of it ſelfe through a cold and moiſt diſtemper, and that either alone, or joyned with a phlegmatick humour, as alſo by cicatriſing after a diſentary, and the immoderate uſe of fat things, and ſuch as cauſe Lubri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city.

                           <p>There is another Iſcury leſſe properly ſo called, or ſuppreſſion of Urine, when little or no Urine is ſent, and comes into the Bladder, which happens when the attractive faculty of the Reins is hurt through diſtemper, eſpecially cold, or is hindered by obſtruction and ſtraitneſſe of the emulgent veſſels, or when the Urine is carried to another place, and is caſt out of the Panch, or by Sweats, or is collected in the Panch, and ſtayes in the firſt paſſages, as in a Dropſie,</p>

                           <p>But a Duſury properly ſo called,
<note place="margin">Difficulty of making Urine.</note> or difficulty of making U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine, is when the time of making water, and the quantity, is a little altered, yet in the very making water, the Urine doth not paſſe out freely, but is made with great ſtriving, pain, and burning, which comes to paſſe by ſome fault of the Urinary paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage; namely, whileſt it is affected with ſome Ulcer, and is ero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, or the Vrine it ſelf being ſharp doth it, or the paſſage was formerly ulcerated.</p>

<note place="margin">Of a Strangury.</note> but becauſe nature is ſenſible of pain, it hinders free emiſſion, the Urine is made drop by drop, and dribling, which is cauſed by crude Urine unconcocted, or having a ſharp humour mixt with it, by Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel ſticking in the neck of the Bladder, or ſome fault of the Uri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary paſſage: whereunto belongs Intemperature of the Bladder, and inflammations of the ſame, and of the parts neer thereunto: hot humours, alſo exulceration of the neck of the Bladder and Urinary paſſage.</p>

<note place="margin">Aboliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and diminiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the mentory &amp; fantaſie.</note> as the imagination, is either aboliſhed, or diminiſhed, principally through the fault of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument, which is the brain: through its too cool a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper thereof, whereunto belongs, not onely innate heat, but default of ſpirits: the default of innate heat is either native, and contracted from our birth, or happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing afterwards from our birth.

                           <p>THe cauſe of a Vertigo is inordinate and circular motion of the animal ſpirits in the brain;
<note place="margin">Of a ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigo.</note> but the cauſes which perform this circular motion in the brain are internal, or external; internal is an inordinate motion of a flatulent ſpirit, moving the animal ſpirits cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly, and exhibiting a falſe repreſentation of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of external things, and of its own body; but this flatulent ſpirit takes the occaſion of its motion, either from its ſelfe, ſeeing that every ſpirit by nature is move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and fluid, eſpecially if it be hotter, and more fervent then ordinary, or moved by ſomewhat elſe, whereas here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after ſhall be ſhewen, which the ſtraitneſs of the veſſels, or of the Pores of the brain occaſioneth; for if both the flatulent ſpirits, and animal ſpirits are moved in paſſages that are obſtructed, they return back and move circularly, they are generated either in the brain, whence a Vertigo by Idiopathy ariſeth, or are ſent from elſewhere upward, either from the whole body, as in ſome Fevers, or from ſome part, as the Stomach, Spleen, Womb, whence it is called a Vertigo by Sympathy, the external and manifeſt cauſes are whatſoever humors can ſuddenly turn into and diſſolve into vapours, or ſtir up an inordinate and circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar motion, with winds, and ſpirits; ſuch as when the conſtitution of the air is ſuddenly altered, immoderate and untimely exerciſe, emptineſſe, baths, anger, turning round of the body, the beholding of bodies ſwiftly tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning round, or otherwiſe moving with violence, looking down from a high place, ſhaking of the head, a fall and ſuch like.</p>
                           <p>The cauſe of an Incubus, or riding of the Mare,
<note place="margin">Of an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cubus.</note> is a thick vapour aſcending from the lower parts of the body and obſtructing the hinder parts neer the Spinal marrow, and hindering the paſſages of the ſpirits to the muſcles of the breſt, whence reſpiration is hindered, which when a man perceives in his ſleep, conſidering various cauſes, he faineth and adviſeth with himſelfe, and even from this
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:36866:67"/>or that, he imagineth himſelfe to be oppreſſed and ſuffo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated in his dream. This vapor is, elevated from thick flegm, or a Melancholy humor reſiding in the Hypocon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dries, or proceeds from ſurfetting, or ſwelling by lying ſupine, or flat on the back: in children alſo a vapour of the ſame nature is occaſioned by worms.</p>
                           <p>A Lethargy commonly proceeds from a flegmatick humor thickning in the brain;
<note place="margin">Of a Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thargy.</note> and ſo the matter of its ſelfe is cold, yet by accident it happens to be hot, but it is impoſſible that out or flegm only putrified, both a fever and a deep ſleep ſhould ariſe; for this humor is neither apt of its ſelfe to admit of putrefaction, eſpecially in the head, neither if it ſhould admit of it, can it utter ſo much as will diffuſe the heat over the whole body, and kindle a Fever, and heart the Heart eſpecially if it putrifie without the ſubſtance of the Brain, or its veſſels in its bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomes and turnings; but it is more agreeable to reaſon that this drouſineſſe either is not a primary diſeaſe of the brain, but occaſioned from ſtupifactive and pituitous va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pors rendring the animal ſpirits dull, and are the Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomes of a Fever, which are called companions; namely, of a continued Quotidian of a baſtard Tertian, and Semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertian, or if it be a primary diſeaſe of the Brain, it doth not ſeem to have its beginning only from putrified flegm, but rather from a petuitous inflammation of the Brain, or from an inflammation ariſing from the blood mixt with flegm. In both theſe Lethargies there is preſent great heavineſſe, and hurt of memory, by reaſon of ſtupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factive, and pituitous vapors, but a delirium, by reaſon of vapors riſen out of the putrid humors troubling the animal ſpirits.</p>
                           <p>The cauſe of a Carus is either the ſtraitneſſe of the Brain by compreſſion,

                           <p>A Catoche hath its beginning from a cold and dry va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pour,
<note place="margin">A Caroche.</note> endued with a peculiar force of fixing the animal
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:36866:67"/>ſpirits ruſhing into the brain, and in ſome ſort ſtopping the ſpirits, rendring them immovable, and, as it were, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gealing them, which for the moſt part is ſtirr'd up by a Melancholy humor; ſuch alſo is the force in a Thunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolt, and it is ſometimes taken from the vapors aſcending out of the earth in an Earthquake, and breaking out of their cells, but the ſpirits ſerving for imagination, and ratiocination are rather fixed and ſtopt then thoſe which lately were diſperſt into the members of the body, which is apparent from hence, that although thoſe that are Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taleptick move no member, yet if they are moved by an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other the power of moving exerciſeth its ſelfe, and being ſtruck they fall down, and moreover ſpreading their eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lids they keep their eyes open.</p>
                           <p>The immediate cauſe of an Apoplexy is a flowing of the animal ſpirits into the organs of the body,
<note place="margin">Of an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poplexy.</note> hindering ſenſe and motion; but the influx of the animal ſpirits is hindered either by the paſſages through which they ſhould flow into the organs of ſenſe and motion, or the narrowneſſe of the beginning of the Nerves, or through the unaptneſſe of the animal ſpirits themſelves, or by too great a quantity, or perturbation of the ſame. The ſtraitneſſe of the paſſages of the animal ſpirits is made when the beginning of the Nerves in the bottom of the brain is ſo ſhut, that the paſſage and way for the animal ſpirits and motion into the organs of all the external ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes are intercepted; a few onely reſiſting, which flow from the Cerebellum, which ſcarce ſuffice for the motion of the breſt which ſtriveth exceedingly for reſpiration. The beginning of the Nerves cauſe this ſtraitneſſe, firſt the flegmatick humor poured into theſe places performs it by obſtruction, or compreſſion, which the Antients took for the principal, nay ſome for the only cauſe of an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexy. Secondly, blood poured out of its veſſels by a ſtroak, or any other cauſe whatſoever into the baſis of the Brain, and preſſing the beginning of the Nerves. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, placing of flegm when the veſſels of the Braine, their being plenty of blood, are filled and ſtretched that the ſubſtance of the Brain is compreſſed, and the Pores and paſſages being made narrower, a free ingreſs for the animal ſpirits into the Nerve is hindered. Fourthly, a blow, or fall violently preſſing the Brain it ſelf, and ſo the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Nerves, rendring the animal ſpirits ſlow,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:36866:68"/>as it were degenerated from their nature, and are made altogether unfit to perform animal actions, bring forth vapors which contain in them a ſtupefactive power; more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over the effuſion of animal ſpirits by deep wounds, and troubling of them by a ſtroak, and by a great fal and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion of the Brain may take away all ſenſe and motion from a man, but that Apoplexy which ariſeth from a pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuitous and ſtupefactive power is the chief, and is under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood for the moſt part when mention is made of a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Apoplexy, to wit, which is occaſioned by its ſefe, when the other Apoplexies by reaſon of the differences of cauſes, either are occaſioned by ſome external and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent cauſe, as by a ſtroak, by a fall, or they follow other diſeaſes.</p>
                           <p>An Epilepſie is occaſioned from a vaporous and thin matter,
<note place="margin">Of an Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lepſie.</note> whether by its acrimony, or venomous and malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant quality vellicating and moleſting the Brain and all the Nerves, and together afflicting the animal ſpirits, darkning and troubling of them: and there are to help this matter forward not onely certain humours corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in a peculiar manner, and fit for an Epileptical diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, but alſo parts of the body corrupted in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, as Worms, After-birth, and ſuch like.</p>

                           <p>OF Signs of this kind there are certain differences;

<pb n="128" facs="tcp:36866:74"/>which belong to a man. Yet how ſuch counterfeit diſeaſes are to be found out. <hi>Galen</hi> teaches in a peculiar Book; but ſince there is a great latitude of health, firſt of all the ſigns are to be propoſed of the beſt conſtitution of body, which is, as it were, a rule for the reſt, and to which, as to the ſtatue of <hi>Polycletus,</hi> the natures of men of all of Ages, Sexes, Countries, and Conditions are to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared. The ſigns of ſuch a Conſtitution, as alſo of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers differing from it, <hi>Galen</hi> in his art of Healing, and fifth Chapter draws from two heads; firſt from thoſe which eſſentially inhere, and which according to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the eſſence are in them. Secondly, from thoſe which neceſſarily follow thoſe in their operations and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents.</p>

<note place="margin">Signs of a ſound body.</note> therefore it is neceſſary that a ſound body may obtain the moſt convenient temperature and conſtitution of the ſimular parts, fitteſt for all actions. Secondly, a convenient number it ought to have of organick parts, and likewiſe magnitude, figure, ſcituation, connexion with others, and all things in all reſpects, which are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to the conſtitution of a part, as it is organick. Thirdly, all the parts in order ought to be united and joined, but in reſpect of actions, a man that is very ſound doth very well perform all the actions convenient for a man, natural, vital, and animal; So that there is no defect in them, and obſerves moderation in them all, and is very little ſubject to diſeaſes, and withſtands all the cauſes of diſeaſes, violent excepted: the excrements obſerve their natural ſubſtance, quality, quantity, time, and convenient part on't; which to be ejected, the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities which follow the beſt conſtitution of a Body, are a roſie colour of the face, nay and of the whole body, ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidity, frigidity, ſoftneſſe and hardneſſe, ſmoothneſſs and roughneſſe; a ſound body well conſtituted obſerves medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ocrity, the body is neither bald, nor too rough, but the hairs themſelves keep mediocrity, and in youthfull age tend to yellowneſſe, in manly to blackneſſe; the habit of the body is the middle betwixt too corpulent, and too ſlender, good fleſh, and good ſtature, out of all which the handſomeneſſe of the body proceeds; yet all theſe moſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidently appear in the middle and flouriſhing age.</p>

<pb n="144" facs="tcp:36866:82"/>Firſt white; ſecondly, pale; thirdly, flame colour; fourthly, yellow; fifthly red; ſixthly, black.</p>
                           <p>Firſt to the white Urines belong the aqueous,
<note place="margin">White U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine.</note> which bare the colour of pure water, then thoſe which repreſent thin wine, or fair water, into which is caſt a little Oker, or Choller, as alſo ſnowy Urine, which repreſents the whiteneſs of ſnow, as alſo milkey and light gray, or ſuch as repreſents the colour of clear horn.</p>
                           <p>The ſecond is pale like the colour of Oker,
<note place="margin">Pale.</note> or ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pallid, which is ſeen in water tinckted with Oker, but ſome call theſe Urines ſpicious, or the colour of ears of corn,
<note place="margin">Straw colour. Flame co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour.</note> and ſubſpicious, and compare this colour to the colour which is ſeen in chaff that is old, or in ſtraw.</p>
                           <p>The third colour is flame colour, ſuch as is that of a Citron, and in fire burning clear, which if it be more remiſs, 'tis called ſubfulgent; <hi>Actuarius</hi> calls theſe golden Urines, and ſubaureous, becauſe they are like gold.</p>
                           <p>Fourthly,
<note place="margin">Yellow.</note> the next and neereſt to this fulgent is yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, yet ſo differing from it, that this inclines more to white,
<note place="margin">Brighter yellow.</note> that is more ſhining and ſplendid, or neer to the colour and ſplendor of the Stars; that which is not ſo deep but clearer, then yellow is called ſubflavous; <hi>Actua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> calls theſe colours croceous, or ſaffron colours, or ſubcroceous, ſuch as are in waters wherein ſaffron, or whilde ſaffron flowers are mixed.</p>
                           <p>The fifth colour, or red, whereof <hi>Galen</hi> makes three ſorts,
<note place="margin">Red.</note> and places red in the middle, extream red, the higheſt, and reddiſh the loweſt, and thoſe he places in Bole-Almonack, and Vermilion, and red, in Cherries and Apples; others make four differences, and firſt they place the colour that is a mixt red, ſuch as is the hair of thoſe who are ſaid to be red hair'd, which again is diſtingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed into red, and reddiſh; the ſecond is Roſie; the third purpurious; the forth ſanguineous.</p>
                           <p>To theſe <hi>Actuarius</hi> joines a vine coloured Urine,
<note place="margin">Vine co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour.</note> which repreſents the colour of a red Urine inclinable to black, to this be addes the colour of dry grapes, like new Wine (out of doubt of red Wine) boiled to the third part,
<note place="margin">Blakiſh.</note> or which is preſt out of dried Grapes, or of Cher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, inclining to a black colour.</p>
                           <p>Moreover there is a black Urine,
<note place="margin">Black Urine.</note> under which ſome-Phyſitians
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:36866:82"/>comprehend more colours, green, yellow, black, and ſuch like; although there be innumerable dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences of green plants, yet two here are the chiefe, Leek-colour, which is ſeen in the blades of Leeks;
<note place="margin">Eruginous</note> and Eru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginous which is like Verdy-greaſe, and yellow, which repreſents the colour of red Lead, and therefore called plumbeous.</p>
                           <p>To theſe differences they refer Oleagenous Urine,
<note place="margin">Oyly Vrine</note> which repreſents the colour and conſiſtence of Oyl.</p>
                           <p>Now theſe differences which are taken from the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance and colour are complicate, and conſtitute,
<note place="margin">The ſmell of Vrines.</note> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound differences, amongſt which the chief are ſeaven, Urine thin and white, thin, pale, thin flame colour, or fulgent, thick white, thick red, thick black</p>
                           <p>Moreover beſides theſe there are other differences leſs principal, which are taken from other qualities and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances; firſt from the ſmell, for ſome Urines ſmell little, others very little, and have that odour which is natural to Urine, others ſtink exceedingly, and others ſmell pleaſant.</p>
                           <p>From the ſound, for ſome Urines whileſt they are poured out make no noiſe, others make a noiſe.</p>
                           <p>From the quantity, for ſome Urines are made in an indifferent quantity, others more ſparingly, others more plentifully.</p>

                           <p>A Content in a Urine is every corpulent and viſible thing which is mingled with the liquor of the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine; ſome Contents are eſſential,

                           <p>Eſſential in reſpect of ſcite or place, in which they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide there are three; the ſediment, the ſuſpenſion, and
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:36866:83"/>the clouds, the altitude of the whole Urine is to be divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, as it were, into three parts, into the bottome of the Urinal, and the higheſt region of the Urine, and the medium betwixt theſe two extreams.</p>

<note place="margin">The ſedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Vrine. The ſuſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Vrine. The nube<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cula.</note> is that in Urine which deſcends towards the bottome, and ſettles in the bottome.</p>
                           <p>Suſpenſion, or ſubliment is that which is contained in the middle, and is, as it were, ſuſpended.</p>
                           <p>The clouds and little clouds is that which hangs in the higher part of the Urine like a cloud, yet ſuſpenſion in Urine is ſometimes taken by <hi>Hypocrates</hi> by the names of a cloud, as in the ſecond of his Prognoſticks, in the 29. Title is manifeſt.</p>
                           <p>Yet theſe Contents do not alwayes exactly keep their natural place, for the ſediment ſometimes plainly ſticks in the bottom, and ſometimes aſcends higher, and tends to ſuſpenſion, and ſometimes ſuſpenſion alſo aſcends a little higher from the middle ſometimes deſcends lower; ſo alſo Clouds plainly overſpread the extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, ſometimes incline towards the middle.</p>

In reſpect of quantity 'tis either little, much, or indifferent, out of which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicated divers other differences again do ariſe.</p>

                           </head>
                           <p>AFter we have mentioned the differences of Vrine,
<note place="margin">Cauſes of Vrine of an indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence. Thin.</note> next we muſt find the cauſes of all thoſe differences; and firſt the cauſe of a Vrine of an indifferent conſiſtence is a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous excrement of blood, mingled with an indifferent quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of water which happens when the faculty concocting is well.</p>
                           <p>The cauſe of a thin Vrine which hath little of that ſerous ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crement mixt with it, is debility of concoction, eſpecially in the Liver and Veins, which coldneſs of the Stomach may oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, but principally ſtore of drink, alſo a cold diſtemper of the Reins. Thirdly, obſtruction, and ſtraitneſs of the veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels through which thick humors cannot flow with the Vrine. Fourthly, the changing and converting of the matter in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther part.</p>
                           <p>Thick Vrine is made by the mixture of any thick matter which happens when crude humors,
<note place="margin">Thick.</note> which are cumulated in the Veins, are expelled by nature this way, or when any obſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is opened out of the Spleen, Liver, Reins, and other parts, or an impoſthumation is broken, or ulcer, the thick matter is mingled with the Vrine, or if there be ſtore of ſerous and ſalt humors.</p>
                           <p>If the Vrine be made clear and remain ſo,
<note place="margin">Clear.</note> and be of good conſiſtence, it is a token that ſuch clearneſs proceeds from the natural heat rightly elaborating the matter, for nature elabo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates not only aliment, but excrements alſo, as much as it can,
<note place="margin">Thin and clear.</note> and impreſſes convenient qualities in them; but if Veine be thin and clear, alſo 'tis a token of crudity; neither hath na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture then begun concoction of humors, and if Vrines have any other colour, then ſuch wateriſh, they obtain it from collerick humors mixt therewith.</p>
                           <pb n="148" facs="tcp:36866:84"/>
                           <p>But if the Vrine be made clear,
<note place="margin">Troubled.</note> and afterwards be troubled, and that be in a ſound body, it is a ſign that he declines from his beſt health, and is prone to ſome diſeaſe, eſpecially a Fever, and it ſignifies the humors in the Veins to be indigeſted, which nature now hath endeavoured, yet hitherto hath not perfectly concocted: but if the ſame happen to thoſe that are ſick, it ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies that ſome concoction is now to be made, and ſomething of the peccant matter to be mingled with the watty ſubſtance; but that mixture not to be ſo exact; and happening by ſome oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion from the external air, or the heat vaniſhing of its own accord; the vitious matter is ſeparated from the other humors.</p>
                           <p>But if Vrine be made thick,
<note place="margin">Troubled, which grows clear.</note> and afterwards become thin, that happens becauſe the natural heat begins to perform and concoct the matter, and to ſtir it, and mingle it, which notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ſince it is not exactly mingled, the heat afterwards cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, the Heterogeneal parts are ſeparated of their own accord, and the thicker reſide in the bottome. The ſame comes to paſs if the Vrine be thin, but ſome matter may be mingled therewith in its paſſage; but ſince it is not exactly mingled with it, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly confuſed afterward of its own accord, it ſettles in the bottom.</p>

<note place="margin">Troubled which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains ſo.</note> if the Vrine be made thick and remain ſo, it ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies great confuſion of humors is made in the Veins by the heat ſtirring the humors, but not rightly concocting them, nor is there good concoction made, which the excrements elaborate to make after their manner, and indeed if ſuch a Vrine appear in the beginning of ſuch a diſeaſe, wherein no concoction ſeems hitherto to be made by the natural heat; it is a token that 'tis cauſed by the fiery heat contrary to nature agitating and troubling the humors in the veins; but if the Vrine in the beginning is not made thick, but clear, and afterwards becomes turbulent, it is a ſign that the diſeaſe grows worſe, and that the heat acting upon the matter contrary to nature is encreaſed, yet always this and alſo other ſigns muſt have regard to the reſt of the conditions of the Vrine, and hence it is to be collected, whether ſuch ſigns be made by the ſtrength of nature working upon the vitious humors, or by the encreaſe of the preter-natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral heat, and putrifaction, or debility of ſtrength.</p>

<note place="margin">The cauſes of a golden colour in Vrine.</note> a golden colour, which agrees to the Vrines of ſound men proceeds according to the vulgar opinion from ſome portion of yellow choller, or
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:36866:84"/>rather from a ſerous and ſalt excrement, yet that alſo ſomething tinctured with choller, which is mixt with the Vrine.</p>
                           <p>A white Water is made,
<note place="margin">Of a whit.</note> either becauſe nothing is mingled with it which may colour it, which is properly called aqueous, or becauſe ſome white body is mixed therewith.</p>
                           <p>The firſt cauſe of aqueous Vrine is Crudity and weakneſs of the native heat, by reaſon whereof this excrement is left,
<note place="margin">Of an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queous.</note> as it were imperfect. Secondly, obſtructions of the paſſages through which the matter uſeth to flow to the Vrine. Thirdly, if chol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, and therewith that ſalt humor be carried to another place, as happens for the moſt part in acute Fevers, and Phren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies with them. Fourthly, much drink. Fifthly, heat of the Reins and Liver, which plentifully draw drink to them, but do not concoct it. Sixthly, Gravel in the Reins, or Bladder, too much of that which is ſalt, and thick adheres, but the aqueous flows out.</p>
                           <p>Vrines of another kind are made by the mixture of ſome white ſubſtance, whether it be flegm, or quitture, or ſeed,
<note place="margin">Of milky</note> and theſe Vrines we call milky, yet for the moſt part they are made thick, and afterwards become clear, and the matter ſetling in the bottome of what kind it is, may be eaſily diſcerned.</p>
                           <p>A Vrine is ſomewhat pale,
<note place="margin">Of paliſh. Of pale.</note> when pale choller in a ſufficient quantity, or a little of yellow is mingled with the Urine, but if much pale choller, or yellow in an indifferent quantity be mingled with the Vrine a pale colour ariſeth.</p>
                           <p>If yellow be mixed in greater quantity,
<note place="margin">Of yellow.</note> the Vrine becomes yellow, yet ſome times other cauſes beſides internal, external may give a tincture to the Vrine, as Rhubarb, Saffron, the leaves of Senna, and ſuch like.</p>
                           <p>A ruddy colour in Vrine is cauſed by choller and blood,
<note place="margin">Of blood red.</note> and indeed if the Vrine be coloured with blood it doth not look clear, and is properly called Vrine dyed with blood, and has a colour like water, wherein the fleſh of animals newly ſlain have been waſhed, and is made either in ſome open veſſel for what cauſe ſoever, or by the weakneſs of the Liver and Reins, by reaſon whereof they cannot contain blood and aſſimulate it to themſelves, or becauſe nature at ſet times evacuates the blood a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounding in the whole body with Vrine; but the blood which is mingled with the Vrine, is either thin, and the Vrine is made red or reddiſh, or thick, which if much be mingled, the Vrine is made exceeding red, but if little either ſimply red, or of a pale red, but that Vrine which is coloured by ſtore of choller, the choller colouring it and and making it redder, it
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:36866:85"/>ſhineth, and is as it were like flame, ſometimes alſo it is made red and thick by plentiful mixture of aduſt choller, like wine of a blackiſh, or deep red.</p>
                           <p>Wine like Vrine is made by the mixture of ceruleous choller,
<note place="margin">Of Vine colour. Of grape colour.</note> or repreſenting the colour of Woad, as alſo by the mixture of plenty of red choller: Grapy by the mixture of yellow choller exceedingly dryed, and as it were changed into a Violet colour and degenerating towards black.</p>
                           <p>A green Vrine is cauſed by plenty of Aeruginous,
<note place="margin">Of green.</note> and Leck-like colour.</p>
                           <p>Yellow and black Vrine are ſometimes cauſed by the mixture of external things;
<note place="margin">Of yellow and black.</note> as for what belongs to the internal cauſes, the Vrine is made black when either the melancholy humour is evacuated with it, which happens in thoſe which cumulate melancholy humours in the Spleen, or black choller is mixed with the Urine, or when the heat and ſpirits are extinguiſhed in the veins, the blood is corrupted and becomes black.</p>

                           <p>SInce all theſe things are ſpoken of Vrines for that end that from thence diſeaſes &amp; the cauſes of diſeaſes maybe known, and the events foretold, that this may be rightly done, we are to admoniſh you what things are to be obſerved in the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection of Vrine.</p>
                           <p>Firſt the time in making water is to be obſerved, thoſe V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rines which are made preſently after eating and drinking,
<note place="margin">When V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine is to be received.</note> ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie nothing certainly, eſpecially if much drink be taken, ſince the decoction is not performed, Vrine is rather to be lookt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on after a perfect concoction, and about the morning. In Fevers regard is to be had of the fits, becauſe in time of the Paroxiſm the morbifique matter is expelled another way.</p>
                           <p>Secondly, it is to be weighed whether any meat, drink, or medicine, be taken which may change the Vrine.</p>
                           <p>Thirdly,
<note place="margin">The whole Vrine to be taken. It ſhould firſt ſettle. In what place ſhould be kept. Inſpection of troubled Vrines.</note> the whole Urine made at once is to be be taken, not to be mingled with waters made at ſeveral times.</p>
                           <p>Fourthly, judgment is not to be given of Urine before it hath ſetled, and the Contents enjoy their proper place.</p>
                           <p>Fifthly, you muſt beware leaſt the Urine by cold air, or winds eſpecially in an open veſſel, being expoſed thereunto, ſhould be changed, or corrupted, yet it may be changed no leſs by too much heat then by too much cold.</p>
                           <p>Sixthly if the Urines are troubled they are to be ſetled by the heat of fire, or rather warm water, that they may return to their former ſtate; yet it is convenient to look upon troubled Urines before they become clear again, ſince often times in troubled Vrines the ſubſtance of the Vrine is more manifeſt then in clear, and often times Vrines which be not troubled ſeem to be alike, when troubled they differ exceedingly; and in troubled Vrines oftentimes that matter of the Vrine ſhews it ſelf, which ſcarce any one could believe had been contained in it when 'twas clear.</p>
                           <p>Seventhly the Vrinal in Inſpection ought to be quiet, and not to be ſtirred, only after Inſpection it may be lawful to ſtir the contents.</p>
                           <p>Eighthly, the Glaſs wherein the Vrine is to be viewed ought to be clear, perſpicuous and void of all colour.</p>

                           <p>Ninthly, the Urine is to be caſt neither in a place too ſhady nor too light, yet the colours in a ſmall ſhade, ſo not too dark, may be diſcerned beſt, but the Contents in a lighter place.</p>

<note place="margin">What can be known by Urine.</note> but without diſpute the Vrine may ſhew that diſpoſition which is in the Liver and Vrines; ſince the Vrine is an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crement of the Veins, of the Reins alſo and paſſages through which the Vrine flows, and the diſeaſes of the Bladder and Yard without controverſie the Vrine may ſhew; for if any thing be contained in the ways through which the Vrine paſſeth contrary to nature; 'tis eaſily mingled with the Vrine: more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over the diſeaſes of thoſe parts which ſend matter to the Veins, may be dſcerned by the Vrine. Whence if any peculiar part be affected, and the Vrine changed alſo; if in the part affected there be alſo made any peculiar change, it is a token that ſuch matter is tranſmitted from that part to the Reins and Bladder. On the contrary, alſo when the matter which is contained in the Veins is carried ſometimes to other part s, and cauſeth vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Symptomes; the diſeaſes of thoſe parts may alſo be known by the Vrines, eſpecially if other Symptomes agree with thoſe of the Vrine.

                           <p>And thus what may be known, and foretold of every Vrine is manifeſt, from thoſe things which are ſpoken of the cauſes of all the differences which happen unto Vrine.</p>

<note place="margin">Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of a Pulſe.</note> Inſtruments of the Pulſe are the Heart and Arteries, and the Heart is the Fountain, Chimny, and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laboratory of heat and vital Spirits; but the Arteires are the Channels through which this vivifying heat is derived from the heart, as from a Fountain, and diſperſt through the whole body, which work that they may rightly perform, power is given to them by nature whereby they can dilate and contract them ſelves by perpetual motion,
<note place="margin">Efficient cauſe.</note> by which means Arteries Blood with the vital Spirits, is diffuſed through the whole body, the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pors are expelled, and cold air is drawn in; neither is the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Heart and Arteries made only by the fervent heat of the Blood and Spirits; nor is this motion to be accounted ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidental,
<note place="margin">Vital fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty.</note> and, as it were, violent, but the heart by a peculiar faculty which it hath in its ſelf, which they call Vital and Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſique is moved; neither are the Heart and Arteries dilated, becauſe they are filled, but they are filled becauſe dilated. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is this faculty denied to the Arteries, although in its own manner, it depends on the heart,</p>
                           <p>The vſe of the Heart and Arteries,
<note place="margin">The uſe of the motion of the heart and arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</note> and the end of their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is the preſervation of the native heat, the generation of vital ſpirits, and the diſtribution of them through the whole bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by; but the native heat is preſerved (as being hotter) whileſt 'tis cooled and fanned, and the matter fit for the generating of ſpirits is drawn, but the fuligenous vapors are expelled.

<pb n="159" facs="tcp:36866:89"/>But becauſe theſe two motions are oppoſite, and a thing cannot be moved againſt its oppoſite unleſs firſt it be quiet.

But con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction is made for expulſion; for the heart when it is dilated attracts blood, the matter of vital ſpirits and arterious blood, and air from the Lungs through the arterious veins; But the Arteries draw ſome of the thinner blood from the Veins, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally they draw aire through their ſmall orifices, opening to the Pores of the Skin: by contraction the Heart expels fuliginous vapors, and together emits arterious Blood and Spirits into the Arteries, but the Arteries expel fuligenous excrements, and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether communicate ſome Spirits and arterial blood to all the parts.</p>

                           <p>But ſeeing to the Pulſe, as alſo to every local motion,
<note place="margin">Simple.</note> five things are required. 1. The thing moving. 2. The ſpace through which the motion is made. 3. Time. 4. The reſt between the two oppoſite motions. 5.

                           <p>A great Pulſe is that which exceeds the ſpace,
<note place="margin">A great and a ſmall Pulſe.</note> which by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is granted for the motion of the Artery. A little Pulſe is that which doth not wholly keep that ſpace.

A thin when long; an indifferent is performed in the middle of thoſe extreams; but that a frequent and thin Pulſe may be rightly perceived, The Pulſes are to be divided into the ſtroak, and the intervall; the ſtroak is the motion of the Artery reſiſting the touch; but the interval is the time in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſed betwixt two ſtroaks, whereby the Artery is contracted and dilated, which by how much the ſhorter or longer it is by ſo much the Pulſe is ſaid to be more frequent or thin.</p>
                           <p>A vehement pulſe is that which ſtrikes the hand of him that feels it,

                           <p>REſpectively or Relatively,
<note place="margin">Reſpective differences of pulſes, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quality and inequali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</note> for either reſpect is had to the equality and inequality, or to order, or to proportion or number; equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and inequality of the Pulſe is nothing elſe but a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruity or difference of one thing in pulſes when compared with another.</p>
                           <p>Equality and inequality is either ſimply and abſolutely ſuch; or <hi>Secundum quid,</hi>
                              <note place="margin">How ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall. Abſolutely equall. Abſolutely unequall.</note> and which is at leaſt in a certaine kinde ſuch.</p>
                           <p>Abſolutely and ſimply, a Pulſe is ſaid to be equall which neither changed in magnitude nor in ſwiftneſs, nor in fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quency nor in vehemency, nor in ſwiftneſs, and if equali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty be obſerved in neither of theſe, it is called a Pulſe abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely and ſimply unequall; but if a Pulſe keeps not equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity in all theſe, neither is made unequall in all theſe; it is ſaid according to ſomething, and in ſome reſpect to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equall, the denomination is to be taken from that wherein it obſerves not equality.</p>
                           <p>Moreover theſe unequalities againe are divided into ſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtematicall or collective,
<note place="margin">Syſtemati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quality. An une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall pulſe equally. unequall.</note> which is obſerved in more ſtroaks, and ſingular, which is in one ſtroake; collective, againe is double, unequality equally, and unequality un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equally; unequall Pulſes are equally when the firſt is ſo to the ſecond, as the ſecond is to the third, the third to the fourth, and ſo forward, unequall; unequall unequally are thoſe which are not alike in their change, neither is the firſt ſo to the ſecond as the ſecond is to the third.</p>
                           <p>We call an unequal Pulſe equally <hi>Myouron,</hi>
                              <note place="margin">Myoures.</note> from the ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude of the tayle of a Mouſe, which as the taile of a Mouſe from ſome thickneſs by little and little and equally tends to ſharpneſs, ſo theſe Pulſes in magnitude are leſſened by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees and equally, and the following ſtroake is alwayes leſs then the former, which ſome call maimed Pulſes.</p>
                           <p>Theſe againe are either deficient <hi>Myourn</hi> which perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally are leſſoned till at length they plainly ceaſe to ſtrike a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more; or ſuch as at length ceaſe to be leſned,
<note place="margin">Deficient Myouroi.</note> and do not plainly give off and reſt; and both of them againe are vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, for ſome keepe that pravity to which they are come
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:36866:91"/>others do not perſevere therein; but returne againe to mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitude,
<note place="margin">Maimed reciprocall.</note> which the Greekes call maimed Pulſes running a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, reciprocall ſhortned, or running Pulſes, and theſe again either return to their former magnitude, or to leſſer, or to a greater.</p>
                           <p>Unequally, unequall Pulſes alſo are various according to all the ſimple differences of Pulſes, but the chief, and thoſe which the Ancients gave names unto, are the intermittent, deficient, the intercedent, or intercurrent.</p>
                           <p>The name of intermittent is attributed to that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equality which is in pravity and rarity,
<note place="margin">Intermit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.</note> or only rarity, namely when the arterie is ſo hindered in ceſſation, that one pulſation ſeems to have two or three, between two which ſeeme to be deficient, and after one or more ſtroakes,
<note place="margin">Intercur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent.</note> the intermittent begins to beat againe.</p>
                           <p>Intercurrent, or ſuch as go between, are oppoſite to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittent, and amongſt them after certain ſtroakes, one or more ſtroakes intervene, which cauſeth inequality of fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quency.</p>
                           <p>A deficient Pulſe is when an artery after it hath made un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equall ſtroakes,
<note place="margin">Deficient.</note> plainly ſeemes to be defective in motion and to ceaſe; which if it returne to its former motion, it is called a reciprocall deficiency,
<note place="margin">Reciprocall defictent.</note> and this is the difference between an intermitting and deficient Pulſe, that a deficient reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procall after a long ſpace between, whereby the man ſeemes to be deſtitute of a Pulſe, returnes, but an intermit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting at the higheſt returns after intermiſſion of five Pulſes.</p>
                           <p>A ſingular inequality is either in one part of an artery,
<note place="margin">A ſingular nequallity.</note> or under one finger, or more, or all; inequality under one finger is, when in dilatation and contraction a certaine diverſity in celerity is obſerved, ſo that one part of one motion is ſwif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, another part is found ſlower, and this inequallity Authors divide into three parts, namely an intermitting Pulſe, an uneven Pulſe, and a haſty Pulſe, or ſtriking double.</p>
                           <p>Intermitting in one Pulſe is when the dilatation of the artery before it can come to its terme and externall reſt,
<note place="margin">Intermit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in one Pulſe.</note> is interrupted in the middle of its motion, and is refreſhed in its reſt, yet ſo that it cannot remaine in reſt but performes motion, and comes to its accuſtomed terme and Externall reſt.</p>
                           <pb n="163" facs="tcp:36866:91"/>
                           <p>Of this kind ſome Authors make many differences,
<note place="margin">Capriſons.</note> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt which the cheife is an uneven Pulſe, when in the Dioſtile as it were in the middle of its reſt tis interrupted, yet ſo that after reſt the faculty ariſeth higher and perfects motion, whence in an uneven Pulſe in one dilatation there is as were a double ſtroke, and indeed the latter ſwiſter then the former.
<note place="margin">
                                 <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>neven.</note>
                           </p>
                           <p>An even haſty Pulſe is when the motion is continuall and interrupted by no reſt,
<note place="margin">ſtirred up.</note> but the part of the diſtending one is ſlower, another ſwifter, as if the motion of diſtention begins ſlowly and afterwards ends ſwiftly, or the contrary.
<note place="margin">Dicrotus.</note>
                           </p>
                           <p>Dicrotus or a double ſtriking Pulſe is when the Artery be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to be moved, but before it perfects its motion it goes back and a ſmall contraction being made it riſeth againe to perfect its motion, and ſtrikes the ſecond time, ſo that a double Pulſation ſeemes to be made, which nevertheleſſe conſiſts of one diſtention or dilatation.</p>
                           <p>In equality in one Pulſe, but under more parts of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery happens, when in one dilatation the Pulſe ſtrikes two, three, or foure fingers, but thoſe unequally, ſo that in one finger the Pulſe is otherwiſe perceived then in another, and that in a twofold manner, for either the motion is interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, ſo that ſome fingers perceive motion, others not, or it is a continued motion, when the Artery is otherwiſe moved un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der other fingers;
<note place="margin">Myourus on Pulſe.</note> and indeed thoſe which are made unequall in magnitude in one Pulſe are called Myourus, namely when the Pulſe under the fore finger is greater, leſſe under the ſecond, leſſe then that under the third, but if the Pulſe under the middle fingers be greater, under both extreame fingers leſſe, they are called prominent Pulſes or Myouroy, changing about unto every part.</p>
                           <p>Out of theſe ſimple differences of inequality other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound do ariſe,
<note place="margin">Prominent.</note> for either a Syſtematicall inequality is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicat with a ſimple, or a Syſtematicall with a Syſtematicall, or a ſingular with a ſingular; out of which compound differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences the cheife are firſt, a rugged or uneven, ſecond full of ſurges, third when it bears as if a worme did creep under ones finger, foure that feeles as if it were a Piſmire, five a ſerrate Pulſe, ſix a hectick, ſeaven a trembling.</p>
                           <p>In an uneven Pulſe whereof we have ſpoken before in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quality is twofold in ſwiftneſſe and violence,
<note place="margin">Capriſons.</note> for one part of the motion is ſwifter the other, more vehement then the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer.</p>
                           <pb n="164" facs="tcp:36866:92"/>
                           <p>In a Pulſe full of waves there are two inequalities,
<note place="margin">A ſurging pulſe.</note> in magnitude and frequeney, namely when the Artery is moved, the motion not interrupted, but unequall, ſo that magnitude may appeare firſt under the fore finger, afterunder the ſecond, then under the third, hence under the fourth; according to the manner of the waves.</p>
                           <p>The Pulſes like the moving of a Worme or Piſmire,
<note place="margin">Virmicall.</note> differ from a ſurging Pulſe only in magnitude, for there is the ſame inequality in that Vermicular as in the waving, but the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery is leſſe and ſlower lifted up, and it renders the Artery as it were into the forme of a creeping worme.</p>
                           <p>This Vermicular Pulſe being leſſe and ſlower,
<note place="margin">Formicant.</note> but very fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent is a Formicant motion, ſo called from the creeping of a Piſmire, which indeed makes quick ſteps, but goes leſſe way in longer time.</p>
                           <p>A Serrat Pulſe is when one part of the Artery is more lif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted up and ſtrikes the fingers more,
<note place="margin">A ſerrate.</note> the other is leſſe lifted up, and ſtrikes the fingers leſſe.</p>
                           <p>A Hectick Pulſe is ſo called from the ſimilitude of a Hectick-Feaver,
<note place="margin">A hectick</note> it alwayes perſiſts in the ſame in equality what ever the inequality be.</p>
                           <p>Laſtly a trembling or fainting Pulſe hath inequality in many Pulſes,
<note place="margin">A trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling.</note> in magnitude, frequency, and vehemency, in the ſame manner, as you may obſerve in the panting of the heart,</p>

                           <p>THe cauſes of pulſes are divided by Phyſitians,
<note place="margin">Cauſes of pulſes of generation.</note> into cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of generation, or immediate and proximate; and cauſes of mutation or remote; or into primary or ſecundary; thoſe they call primary which make the pulſe, and which being put there is a pulſe, and being taken away there is none;
<note place="margin">Of commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</note> thoſe which do not make a pulſe but alter and change it are three, the faculty, or uſe or end; theſe are many, whereof ſome belong tonaturall things, as tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, ſex, age, habite of body; others to things not natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, as aire, meate and drinke, exerciſe, reſt, ſleeping, weaking, excretions, retentions, paſſions of the minde; others to preter-naturall namely, diſeaſes, cauſes of diſeaſes, and ſymptomes.</p>
                           <p>The cauſes of pulſes containing, each of them have two differences,
<note place="margin">Proper and unſepera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</note> for the faculty is either ſtrong or weake, the uſe is increaſed or diminiſhed, the inſtruments are ſoft or hard, hence ſome pulſes do perpetually ariſe of one cauſe onely, which <hi>Gallen</hi> calls the neceſſary conſequent, others call proper, and unſeparable; and ſuch like pulſes only follow the faculty and iuſtruments, but not the uſe, and of neceſſitie a ſtrong pulſe neceſſary followes a ſtrong faculty, a weake pulſe, a weak faculty; hard arteries, make a hard pulſe, ſoft arteries make a ſoft pulſe, ſome although they are made more from one cauſe containing then another, yet they do not ariſe from that only,
<note place="margin">Familiar.</note> but tis neceſſary that others concur alſo, which they call familiar; the familiar pulſes of a ſtrong facultie, are great, ſwift, thin, weake ſmall, ſlow, frequent; the uſe increaſed, great, ſwift, frequent; diminiſhed, little, ſlow, thin; a ſoft arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, great, ſwift, thin; hard artery, little, ſlow, thick.</p>
                           <p>Compound cauſes make compound differences, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:36866:94"/>two, ſometimes three cauſes, are complicate; firſt,
<note place="margin">The ſacul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty with the uſe chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged; what pulſes it makes.</note> a ſtrong faculty, and the uſe increaſed; the inſtruments obtaining a naturall conſtitution make pulſes, great, ſwift, frequent, and moreover vrhement, a ſtrong faculty and the uſe leſſened brings forth pulſes, moderate in mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitude, ſlower, thinneſs, yet vohement; from an infirme faculty and the uſe moderately increaſed comes a pulſe moderate in magnitude and celerity, frequent, languiſhing; but if the force be very weake, the pulſe is little, ſlow, very frequent, weake; from a faculty weakned and uſe dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed ariſeth ſmall pulſes, flow, thick, fainty; and if there be very great debility, the very leaſt intermittent and defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent pulſes ariſe.</p>
                           <p>Secondly, if the uſe and inſtrument be joyned together,
<note place="margin">The uſe changed and inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> the uſe increaſed with a ſoft inſtrument, makes great pulſes, ſwift, moderate in frequency; or if there ſhall be great exceſs, frequent, and ſoft; the uſe increaſed, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments hard, bring forth leſſer pulſes, ſwifter, more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent; if hardneſs abound; but if uſe, greater; if indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, there is exceſs of them both; if moderate in magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, they are ſwift, frequent; the uſe diminiſhed with a ſoft inſtrument, cauſeth moderate pulſes, in magnitude, ſlow, thin, ſoft; the uſe diminiſhed with a hard inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment renders the pulſes leſs, ſlow, hard: and the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment exceeding in hardneſs inclines the pulſe to ſmalneſs, rather then to ſlowneſs, contrariwiſe it happens when re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frigeration exceeds.</p>
                           <p>Thirdly, if the faculty and inſtrument be complicate,
<note place="margin">Faculty and influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> and the faculty be ſtrong, the inſtrument ſoft, the pulſes are manifeſtly made greater, ſomewhat duller, thinner, and ſofter; a ſtrong faculty, and hatd inſtruments bring forth ſmall pulſes, frequent, and for the moſt part ſwif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, namely if hardneſs abound, but in an equall receſs of them both, the pulſes are moderate in all, yet harder; a weake faculty with ſoft inſtruments makes for the moſt part pulſes in magnitude, and ſwiftneſs moderate and ſoft, but in an immoderate receſs, they ſhall be little, ſlow, frequent. And if the faculty be very infirme, the pulſes be come ſmall, dull, and frequent; Laſtly, if the faculty be infirme with the inſtrument hard, pulſes that are little, ſlow, thicke, and hard do ariſe.</p>
                           <pb n="170" facs="tcp:36866:95"/>
                           <p>But ſometimes all theſe three are complicate,
<note place="margin">Faculties, inſtruments and uſe.</note> and indeed, firſt the faculty ſtrong, the uſe increaſed, the inſtruments ſoft make great Pulſes; ſwift, moderate, in frequency, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement, ſoft.</p>
                           <p>Secondly, if theſe ſhould be complicate, a ſtrong fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, the uſe increaſed, and the inſtruments hard; and that hardneſs be little, but the uſe very much increaſed, the pulſes are made greater then is fit, ſwifter, and more frequent; but if the hardneſs be not great nor the uſe much increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, the pulſes are moderate in magnitude, and become more ſwift and frequent.</p>
                           <p>Thirdly, if the faculty be more ſtrong, the uſe diminiſhed and the inſtrument ſoft, the pulſes are moderate in magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, ſlower, thinner, vehement and ſoft, and if the uſe be much diminiſhed, are plainly leſs, ſlow and thin.</p>
                           <p>Fourthly, If the faculty be ſtrong, the uſe diminiſhed, and inſtruments hard, the pulſes are leſſer, In celerity and frequency moderate, or alſo if the uſe be great, and that there be a receſs of the inſtrument from mediocrity, the pulſes are ſlower and thinner, but the hardneſs of the inſtrument abounding, there is a great receſs of the uſe from Nature, and the pulſes are ſmall, ſlow, and more frequent.</p>
                           <p>Fifthly, If the faculty be weake, the uſe increaſed, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments ſoft, the pulſes are become moderate in magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude and celerity, yet more frequent, but if the power be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly weakned, it makes a ſmall pulſe, ſlow and moſt frequent.</p>
                           <p>Sixthly, If the faculty be weake, the uſe increaſed, and the inſtruments hard, the pulſes are made little, ſlow, and frequent.</p>
                           <p>Seventhly, If the faculty be weake, the uſe diminiſhed, and the inſtrument ſoft, the pulſes are leſſer, moderate in frequency, or rather thin.</p>
                           <p>Laſtly, if the faculty be weake, the uſe diminiſhed, and the inſtruments hard, pulſes are made ſmall, ſlow, frequent, but yet not alwayes of the ſame ſmallneſs, ſlowneſs and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quency, but according to the exceſs of the cauſes are, leſſer, ſlower, or more frequent.</p>
                           <p>But here it is to be noted, firſt, that the force and power of cauſes are more to be valued then nuthe mber, fince one more potent cauſe can do more in changing pulſes then many weaker; ſecondly, the hardneſs of the Artery alwayes
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:36866:95"/>doth reſiſt the magnitude of the pulſe, but not the celerity and frequency; thirdly, there is no more efficacious cauſe of ſmall pnlſes then weakneſs of ſtrength and vertue.</p>

                           <p>ALthough from the cauſes of pulſes,
<note place="margin">Great pulſes what they ſignify.</note> it eaſily appeares what every pulſe ſignifies, and portends: yet that we may add ſomething of each in particular, a great pulſe although principally its familiar uſe be in increaſing, a ſtrong faculty, and a ſoft inſtrument; in thoſe which are ſick it ſignifies a hot diſeaſe, and a great pulſe, unleſſe it be hindered, followes all feavers, and it cannot be much dilated with the Artery, unleſſe the power be ſtrong, or at leaſt not weake; a great pulſe in all feavers is good ſigne.</p>
                           <p>A ſmall pulſe argues either debility of the faculty, or remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the uſe, or hardneſſe of the inſtruments; and indeed if a ſmall pulſe ſhall be alſo faint tis a token that its weakneſs proceeds from a weake faculty, if ſmall and hard, from the Artery; if neither debility; nor hardneſſe be perceived in the pulſe; it is an argument that it comes from the diminution of the uſe: whence little pulſes with a weake faculty foretell death; the reſt of pulſes that are ſmall for the moſt part preſage long and difficult diſeaſes.</p>
                           <p>A ſwift pulſe ſignifies that the uſe is increaſed and the vigour ſtronge,
<note place="margin">A ſwift.</note> or certainly not very weake, whence in thoſe that are ſound, a ſwife pulſe ſignifies heate, ſtirred up by motion, exerciſes, baths and ſuch like cauſes, which if it be alſo great, the ſtrength is not yet debilitated, but in thoſe which are ſick, a ſwift pulſe ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies a hot diſeaſe, and is proper to thoſe which are fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veriſh, and if magnitude be joyned therewith itſhewes that the uſe is increaſed, with ſtrength of nature, but if frequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy be adjoyned without magnitude, it ſhews that the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers are weakned; if hardneſſe of the inſtrument, the uſe being increaſed, hinders dilatation, that hardneſſe is to be percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by the touch.</p>
                           <p>A ſlow pulſe ſhews,
<note place="margin">Slow.</note> the contrary, to wit, little heate and the uſe diminiſhed, and then it is onely thin, and the vigour not firme enough, and withall it is feeble.</p>

                           <p>Thin pulſes are made, either through a ſtrong faculty,
<note place="margin">Thin.</note> and a ſoft inſtrument, or from the uſe diminiſhed; in ſound bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies it ſignifies a cold conſtitution, but in ſidk a cold diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, and coldneſs of the heart, and that which is contained therein, and therefore 'tis accounted an ill ſigne.</p>
                           <p>A ſtrong and vehement pulſe, ſhews a ſtrong faculty,

                           <p>A faint pulſe on the contrary,
<note place="margin">Faint.</note> ſignifies powers to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, and that either by diſſipation of ſpirits and reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and then it is alſo ſmal, and if uſe hinder not, ſlow, or by oppreſſion, occaſioned by plenty of humours, and then the pulſe alſo is inordinate, and unequal.</p>
                           <p>A ſoft pulſe ſhews ſoftneſs of the arterie,

<note place="margin">Cauſes of the change<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the tongue,</note> there are two principal cauſes, humors, exhaling out of the veins and arteries of the tongue, and principally affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting the coat of the tongue; moreover, vapours and humors aſcending from the inferior parts, to which notwithſtanding ſometimes humours flowing from the head are added.</p>

                        <p>Amongſt the cauſes the firſt are thoſe things which are ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in, whereof ſome have power of hurting this,

                        <p>Thirdly, thoſe things which are retained, they more of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend that part wherein they are detained. 4ly. Thoſe things which happen and befal us externally, they alſo ſhew the part affected: if any one uſe mercuriall vunctions, it is probable that the nervous parts are hurt, that evil which commonly overſpreads ſignifies that part to be hurt, which is manifeſt, doth labour in other ſick perſons. By things eſſentially inhearing, here are underſtood both the propri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eties of the parts, and the diſeaſes themſelves inhearing, for although diſeaſes are not of the eſſence, of a part as it is a part; yet as it is an effect centrary to nature: diſeaſes them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſeem to be in a part eſſentially; inherent diſeaſes therefore indicate parts affected, a tumour appearing any where ſignfies either that part is affected, or the part which is placed above it; and the ſcituation and figure of the Tumour, and the motions hurt will ſhew it in its kinde; a falling of the guts into the codds
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:36866:106"/>ſignifies a rupture of the <hi>peritoneum,</hi> or rim of the belly; gibboſity ſignifies hurt of the ſpine, or marrow; the propri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety of parts ſhews places affected as they are proper to thoſe parts, ſo if we ſee ſtones come forth with Urine, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt we conjecture the veines or bladder to be affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted.</p>
                        <p>As for the effect,
<note place="margin">Effects. actions hurt.</note> firſt an action hurt ſhews that member by which it is offended, unleſs it be hurt by ſome external error; ſo ratiocination being hurt, imagination, memory, they ſignifie the brain to be affected; as likewiſe by ſleep, watchfulneſs, exerciſe of the whole body; The viſive fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty is hurt by an affect of the eye; the hearing, of the ear; the ſmelling of the noſe; the taſte ſpoiled is a token of a diſeaſe of the tongue; if the urine be ſuppreſſed, the cauſe is to be ſought in the reines, uriters, bladder, or urina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry paſſages, if yellow choller be not purged from the blood, blood, it is a token that the bladder of the gall is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempered.
<note place="margin">Paine,</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>Hitherto belongs paines, which ſhews that ſome ſenſible part is affected, yet a differing paine may be a ſigne of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers parts; a pricking paine is proper to inflamations of membranes; a ſtriking paine, is cauſed by parts ſenſible which are inflamed, containing arteries; a burthenſome paine agrees to the whole ſubſtance of the bowels, lungs, liver, ſpleen, reines; inward, deep and profound paines, as it were breaking the part, ſignifies the membrances of the bones to be affected; a broad paine, &amp; ſpreading it ſelf eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry way about, is a token that the membrances are affected; ſtreightneſs ſhews ſomewhat belonging to the extending of the nerves.</p>
                        <p>The vital actions being hurt ſhews that the heart la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours.

                        </p>
                        <p>Secondly, in excrements which alſo afford ſignes, more things are to be conſidered, namely the kinds, qualities, manner of caſting them out, quantity, order; the kinds of excrements are two-fold, for either ſomething is caſt out of the ſubſtance of ſome part, &amp; ſignifies that part to be affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as if a little ſkin orflake, or little peece of fleſh ſhould be caſt out of the mouth, it ſhews the lungs, the wind-pipe,
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:36866:106"/>the Epiglotis, the gullet or ventricle, to be corroded; and if it be caſt out by a cough, it is a ſigne that it comes from the breſt, but if it be caſt out by vomit, it is a ſigne it comes from the ſtomack; or that it is not the ſubſtance it ſelf, but that which it contained in it, and is familiar to it, that is ſo ejected, ſo meat, drink, or chile caſt out by reaſon of a wound, ſhews that the ſtomack is proforated, or that the guts are too thin, and if the ſtomack be hurt, the ſick wil belch much; if the guts, the wind goes out by the ſeat; u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine flowing out through an Ulcer or wound, ſhews that the bladder, uriters, or reins are hurt; but which of theſe parts are affected, the ſcituation of the wound diſcovers. The dreggs of the belly ejected through a wound, or the ſmel of the dung perceived in the wound, ſhews that the guts, eſpecially the thick, are hurt. So alſo of other parts.</p>
                        <p>But ſeeing that the ſame things may often come forth from many parts; the quality of the excrement, and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of its coming out, ſhews which is the part affected: if the blood be thinner, hotter, more florid, and comes out leaping, it ſhews that the arterie is cut; but if it be thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and comes out without leaping, or dauncing, it ſhews that the veins are hurt; blood that comes from the paunch, ſhewing like that wherein meat hath been waſhed, ſhews that the liver is affected; if any come forth only by ſpit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it ſhews that the mouth, or parts next to it are affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, unleſs perhaps it flow from the head into the mouth; if by ſpittle, the chaps or larynx are affected; if by cough the wind-pipe, or lungs, ſo that it doth not raiſe a cough by defluxion from the head; if by vomit, the throat and ſtomack, ſo that it come not into the ſtomack from the liver, or ſpleene, or other parts adjacent.</p>
                        <p>The quantity alſo of excrements afford ſignes; if much blood is caſt out, it is a Token of an affect of the lungs; if little, of the wind pipe.</p>
                        <p>That blood which flows from the reins is more; from the bladder leſs.</p>
                        <p>Moreover, order in excrements is a token of the place affected; if firſt blood, and afterwards dreggs are caſt out, it ſignifies that the fundament, or ſome gut is affected within; if firſt dreggs come forth, afterwards blood, it ſhews the guts are thin, or the parts above them are affected; ſo if quitture which is brought forth in the Urine come before, it ſhews
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:36866:107"/>there is an ulcer in the gut colon, if it follow it ſhews that the ſuperior parts are ulcerated.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly,
<note place="margin">Qualities changed.</note> qualities changed alſo affords ſignes of places affected, red colour of the cheeks ſignifies inflamation of the lungs, the colour of the body, but principally of the face, pale or yellow ſhews that the bladder of the gall is not right, the fleſh and ſkin being yellow, in dicate the bones that are under them to be corrupted, a filthy ſmel exha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling from the noſtrils, ſhews that the parts within the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrils are affected; if from the mouth, it ſhews that the teeth, chops, lungs, or ſtomack are affected; if from a wound of the paunch, it ſignifies that the guts are wounded; hardneſs of the right Hypocondrie is a ſigne that the liver is affected, of the left that the ſpleen is affected.</p>
                        <p>Laſtly, certain diſeaſes pertain to effects following, other diſeaſes of the place affected, which are therefore called ſymptomatick, or familiar, and are diſcoverers of the prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry diſeaſe.

                        <p>Moreover it is to be enquired whether a part be primarily hurt, or by conſent of other parts; that is known firſt from <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Namely if a part which is affected be hurt by no evident cauſe, but a part with which it hath conſent, hath ſuffered ſome evil, tis probable that that part is affected by conſent. Secondly, if any hurt coheres with the hurt of another member, that by increaſing of the one the other increaſed, and by the decreaſe thereof it be

                        <p>Thirdly,
<note place="margin">From the courſe of fits.</note> in the fits the houre is to be conſidered in which the Paroxyſme returnes, the time of duration, and the vehemency of Symptomes, for if the fits returne ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and the latter be longer then the former, and more vehement, it is a token the diſeaſe is increaſed: on the contrary, if the latter fits return ſlower, and endure a ſhorter time, and are not ſo violent, it is a ſigne the diſeaſe abates; but ſometimes Paroxyſmes, enveigh equally and all of them return at the ſame houre, which moſt commonly is a ſign of a long diſeaſe, but ſometimes they come not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually, but at ſeverall houres, which ſhewes that the diſeaſe will be ſhorter, and is neerer to the ſtate.</p>
                        <p>Moreover, if the fits come ſooner, and that equally, the ſigns of concoction not appearing, it is the beginning, but if they anticipate more hours then before, it is in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe; when they obſerve equality again a good while, it is the ſtate; when laſtly the omitting or abating of the fits happens to be various, it is the declination: If the order of
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:36866:110"/>the fits, ſo that ſometimes they come too ſoon, ſometimes too late, and ſometimes equally, and at certain times. When the fits do equally invade without the ſignes of concoction, tis the beginning, but when they anticipate not, tis the aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation; when they obſerve equality, it is the eſtate: And laſtly when the coming late happens again, tis the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination; but if the order of fits be various, ſo that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the Paroxyſmes invade equally, ſometimes anticipate, and ſometimes come later; when the fits equally invade without ſignes of concoction, the beginning is; when they come too ſoon no more, the ſtate is; but when they come too late, the declination is.</p>
                        <p>As for the longitude and magnitude of fits,
<note place="margin">In longi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.</note> if the time of intermiſſion or declination be ſhort, and they are neither plainly intollerable, nor altogether free from Symptomes, it is a ſigne of the increaſe. On the other ſide, if the abating or the intermiſſion be long, eaſie to be indured, and free from all Symptomes abſent, declination is ſhewn.</p>
                        <p>But the moſt certain ſignes of the times of diſeaſes, are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion and crudity, for whenſoever a ſign of concoction ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears ſuddenly, it ſhews the diſeaſe will be ſhort and termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate in health, but a ſigne of crudity ſhews the diſeaſe will continue long, or even prove deadly; and if grievous Symptomes grow upon the ſick, ſo that they come with ſignes of concoction, they need to trouble no man, but if they happen without ſignes of concoction and with crudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, they portend danger.</p>

                        <p>ANd theſe things are ſpoken of Prognoſticks in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, now we are to ſpeak of thoſe three,
<note place="margin">The event of a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe foure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold.</note> which uſe to be preſaged, namely the event of a diſeaſe, the time of the end, and the manner: but the event of a diſeaſe is fourfold, for ſome diſeaſes kill the diſeaſed, others plainly leave them off, ſo that the ſick returne to their perfect health; others neither kill the ſick, nor leave them off, but accompany them even to deaths doore; others are changed into other diſeaſes, and ſomtimes into worſe, ſomtimes into milder.</p>
                        <p>The event of a diſeaſe is known by comparing the ſtrength of nature with the diſeaſe, and by the longitude of a diſeaſe,
<note place="margin">When it may be known.</note> or the ſtate with the time to come; for if the ſick paſſe over the ſtate, there is no need, that he ſhould any more feare the danger of death by that diſeaſe; becauſe after the ſtate no man dyeth in the declination by the power of that diſeaſe.</p>
                        <p>The ſignes of ſtrength and weakneſſe of nature are ſought principally from cauſes, and effects:
<note place="margin">Signes of ſtrength and debi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</note> the proximate cauſe of the ſtrength of nature is a natural conſtitution of the parts. And this, by how much the neerer it is to the naturall tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rature, conſtitution and naturalll unity, by ſo much it ſignifies the firmerſtrength; by how much the more remote, by ſo much the weaker. For ſtrength of nature principally depends upon a naturall temperament, whereunto belongs age alſo and ſex; for in men and youths the ſtrength is firmer; in women, old men and boyes, weaker. Remote cauſes are all thoſe things, which by whoſe intervening the ſtrength of a naturall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution is increaſed, or preſerved, or diminiſhed; ſuch are thoſe things, that are taken in, which are carried about, which happen externally, and that are evacuated, and retain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; for if all theſe things have been moderate heretofore, and are moderate, it ſhewes ſtrength of nature; if immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, imbecility. Amongſt the effects are firſt, actions, which, by how much the more they are obſerved according to nature, by ſo much the more they ſignifie health: on the contrary, by how much the more or more noble they are, or by how much the more they are hurt, by ſo much the more
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:36866:111"/>they ſhew the ſtrength to be weakned: Secondly, Excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſignifie nature to be powerfull, when in their ſubſtance, quantity, and quality they are moſt like to na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall, but they ſignifie the contrary, if they are contrary. Laſtly, qualities changed, by how much the neerer they ſhall be to the qualities of ſound men, by ſo much they ſhew the greater ſtrength in the diſeaſed; by how much they differ from them, by ſo much the more imbecillity.</p>
                        <p>The ſtrength of a Diſeaſe is known from things eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall,
<note place="margin">Signs of a ſtrong diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſe.</note> inhering cauſes, and effects, or conſequent Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomes.</p>
                        <p>As for what belongs to a conſtitution contrary to nature, the difference which follows the form of a Diſeaſe, or the cauſes, or the ſubject, afford ſignes of the event; if the Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe be great it indicates danger and death, if little health, and by how much the fewer and more gentle thoſe Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomes are that ſhew what the diſeaſe is, by ſo much the leſſe the ſtrength of the diſeaſe is ſhewn; but by how much the more or greater they are, by ſo much the more vehement is the Diſeaſe: but principally malignity ought to be ſuſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted alwaies; a diſeaſe alſo, by how much the more it reſides in a noble part, or may draw in a noble part by conſent, by ſo much the more dangerous; but that which is in an igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble part is out of danger.</p>
                        <p>The cauſes are ſuch, as either bring forth a diſeaſe, or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions which have gone before it. or ſuch as are helpers and ſupporters of a Diſeaſe.</p>
                        <p>The efficients are either Internall or Externall, internall are either ſolid bodies, or fluid; Diſeaſes therefore which proceed from ſolid matter, as from ſtones, gravell, eſpecially ſuch as is great, for the moſt part are incurable; Diſeaſes which ariſe from humours are dangerous, if they offend in the whole ſubſtance, and are malignant, if they are very purred, if plentifull, endued with miſchievous qualities, and inhere in a noble part, and are crude; thoſe which are contrary indicate the Diſeaſe to be leſs dangerous: Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes which ariſe from blood for the moſt part are whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, from yellow and pale choller not very dangerous, from leek coloured choller, and the colour of the Yolk of an Egge, for the moſt part deadly.</p>
                        <pb n="201" facs="tcp:36866:111"/>
                        <p>The Aeruginous for the moſt part all are mortall, as thoſe from black. A Diſeaſe alſo from an humour perverſly thin, is more dangerous then if it be mingled with ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther more mild.</p>
                        <p>Diſeaſes alſo which proceed from many vitious humours mixed together, are more dangerous then thoſe that ariſe from a ſingle humour, regard nevertheleſſe being had to the nature of the peccant humour.</p>
                        <p>Diſeaſes alſo are more dangerous which proceed from a humour cauſing a tumour, then from a quiet, ſo that it doth not adhere quietly to a noble part. As for the exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall and evident cauſes, this is to be noted of them in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, if they trouble the body long and violently, and are withall malignant, and continue long in the body, they ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie a dangerous Diſeaſe; thoſe which are contrary tend more to health, and are leſſe dangerous. Of the diſpoſitions of bodies, <hi>Hippocrates</hi> 2. <hi>Apho.</hi> 34. writes thus.</p>
                        <p>Thoſe are leſſe dangerouſly ſick, whoſe diſeaſe is ſutable to nature, or age, or cuſtome, or time of the year, then they whoſe diſeaſes are agreeable to none of theſe.</p>
                        <p>Moreover, if Adjuvants,
<note place="margin">Effects and Symptomes.</note> whether they are externall or internall, or from nature, or from art, help, they ſignifie a healthy Diſeaſe, and not a dangerous; but hurtfull things, if they hurt not, ſhew that nature is well: On the contrary, if thoſe things which ought to help, do not help, they ſhew that the Diſeaſe is dangerous and deadly.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, for what belongs to effects and Symptomes, by how much the Symptomes are lighter, by ſo much the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe is more gentle, by how much they are greater, by ſo much the Diſeaſe is more violent.</p>
                        <p>The plurality of Signes are not only to be handled here,
<note place="margin">Dignity of ſignes.</note> but the gravity and dignity of good and evill ſignes are to be conſidered and compared amongſt themſelves, and with the ſtrength of the Sick; for the dignity of ſignes is principally to be valued in reſpect of life, and alwaies thoſe are counted moſt worthy which indicate the force or imbecility of the vitall faculty.</p>

But thoſe which are occaſioned whilſt the matter is crude, by reaſon whereof the body cannot grow hot with e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill evacuations, or when no evacuation followeth, and which happens with ill ſignes, are all evill.</p>
                        <p>Sloath of apprehenſion,
<note place="margin">Torpor.</note> ſpecially of the body cauſed by cold, is perpetually evill, and without a feaver or Apoplexy, it pretends manifeſt danger in feavers, by reaſon of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhing of the native heat.</p>

<note place="margin">The ſtrength of the vitall faculty.</note> the ſtrength and weakneſſe of the vitall faculty, which are of greateſt force in foreſhewing ſafty, or death, we obſerved principally from the pulſe and reſpiration. Of the pulſe tis ſpoken already, onely we repeate this, that the moſt languiſhing, moſt dull, and moſt thin, are the worſt of all; after theſe the leaſt and ſofteſt, and hardeſt; next the moſt frequent, but not ſwift, nor great; only amongſt extreames the moſt vehement is the beſt, yet we muſt diligently obſerve alwayes, whither the change of the pulſe ariſe from the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, or come from externall cauſes.</p>
                        <p>Hereunto belongs the Palpitation of the heart, ſwounding and falling downe, as it were dead, which indicate dejection of the vitall faculty, and great danger, if they happen through ſome diſeaſe of the heart it ſelfe.</p>

As to the ſubſtance, the goodneſſe of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance with a good colour, promiſeth health; thin urines with a good colour promiſe health, yet they ſhew a diſeaſe which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires longer time for concoction. Thin and red urins ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy a crude diſeaſe 2. <hi>prog.</hi> 30. but thick, which are made ſo after the beginning of a diſeaſe are alſo good, if they were thin before, much urine if it be made on a criticall day is good, which ſomtimes is profitably made with ſharpneſſe, and paine.</p>
                        <p>Troubled urine, not ſetling in the bottome, becauſe the ſtrength of the diſeaſed perſiſts, argues for the moſt part the diſeaſe to continue long; if imbecility of the fick be preſent, it denotes their death, but thoſe which grow cleare are bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. As for the colours of waters, a pale red, a light ſafron co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, and a kind of cleer clay colour are good, neither is a red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſh colour with a reddiſh and light ſediment to be found fault with, but on the other ſide bright ſhinning urines, and white are evill; and eſpecially if they appeare ſuch, in Phrenſies, 4. <hi>Agho.</hi> 72. principally, if they are ſo in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of a diſeaſe, and continue ſo long; thin, and red, ſignify the diſeaſe is crude, and moreover tis dangerous if they continue ſo long; black urine in acute diſeaſes, unleſſe they are emitted on a criticall day, allwayes denote great danger; after black, the oyly are the worſt, yellow, and green alſo are nought, and green urines if they appeare ſo ſuddenly in men that are in other reſpects ſound, with biting of the heart, tis a ſigne they have drank poiſon, and they are in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of death, but in feavers they are mortall ſignes; eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially if they appeare in the beginning of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſe.</p>
                        <p>As for the quanity <hi>Hippo.</hi> 3. <hi>Epid. com.</hi> 3. <hi>tom</hi> 4. condemnes thin urins made in great quantity; as alſo much urine, thick, not reſiding and no way helping; and all urines are made in great quantity in the beginning, are diſliked; ſmall quantities of urines in acute feavers are alſo nought.</p>
                        <p>As to the contents, thoſe urins are evill which have no ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diment, and nothing that ſwimmeth in the urinall in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt of the urine, nor a little cloud; unleſſe the ſick hath faſted long, or watched, or laboured: or becauſe the body is exceeding full of choler; thick waters alſo without a ſediment are dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, and a ſediment repreſenting, the forme of thick brain, is evill, but worſt of all, if it reſide in a manner like ſcales of
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:36866:115"/>Fiſh, but if it be thin and white tis vitious; but that which is furfuraceous or like Bran is worſt of all, <hi>Hippo.</hi> 2. <hi>prog.</hi> 28. a nubecula, or little cloud, which is carried in the Urine, if it be white tis good, if black tis nonght; tis evill alſo for the ſick to make water and not know of it.</p>
                        <p>Secondly,
<note place="margin">Of dejecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the helly.</note> the dejections of the belly afford us ſignes two manner of waies; firſt, as they ſhew the concoction of the ſtomack and guts, alſo as they manifeſt the humours flowing from other parts to the guts; As for the firſt kind, that ejection is beſt if it be gentle and conſtant; and ſent forth at that time when it is wont to be in the beſt health, if quantity be according to what hath been eaten, 2. <hi>Apho.</hi> 13. The latter is good if it be criticall, and with ſignes of concoction in the ſtate of a diſeaſe, and happen on a cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall day, and eaſe the ſick, 1. <hi>Apho.</hi> 2. On the other ſide ill dejections, and thoſe which portend deſtruction, derogate from the good in ſubſtance, colour, ſmell, time wherein they appear, nor are they voided with eaſe.</p>
                        <p>As to their ſubſtance and quantity, dry excrement and rolled up in clods are ſignes of fiery heat, and if be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides they ſhall be black, they declare a burning diſeaſe to be in the middle of the body, and for that reaſon are evill: On the contrary liquid excretion is not evill, if it have other good notes; but the watry ordure is worſe, and proceeds from greater crudity; and moreover in chole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick diſeaſes, with ill Urines tis deadly, but in more milde it ſignifies the diſeaſe will continue long. A glutinous, white, light, fat, and foetid ordure, and little, are condemned, 2. <hi>Prog.</hi> 21, 22. Cleare dejections alſo in acute diſeaſes are condemned, 2. <hi>Prorrh.</hi> 15. and froathy, and cholerick ejections in acute cholerick diſeaſes are accounted evill, <hi>ibid. Apho.</hi> 18.</p>
                        <p>As to the colour, excrements which differ from the naturall colour, are white; red, bloody, watry, green, yellow, black, full of mixt colours, unleſſe they are emitted cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tically they portend danger: Yet in all theſe ejections in judging of them, regard is to be had of the meat, and to take heed you obſerve whether that quality hath its riſe from dyet that hath been taken; for they become white either by the obſtructing of the paſſages through which choler deſcends to the guts, or through the motion of the choler to ſome ſuperiour and more noble part,
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:36866:116"/>Red are alſo of themſelves dangerous, yet if they are extru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded after the victory of nature, they rather ſhew hope of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent health, then portend any thing of evill.</p>
                        <p>Black Excrements ſince they proceed either from blood or melancholy humours, or from black choler, that blackneſſe which comes from concrete blood, or a melancholy humour, is not alwaies evill: but pure black choler can never be ſent out of the body without deſtruction of the ſick.</p>
                        <p>Green and aeruginous ordure which proceeds from aerugi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous choler tending to black, is an argument of a pernicious diſeaſe, if it be caſt out from any principall part, and the bowels be affected with an Eryſipelous; if the Excrements are yellow, they ſignifie vehement cold in the internall parts, and as it were a certain mortification: Ejections alſo of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers colours are evill, 2. <hi>Prog.</hi> 23.</p>
                        <p>Faetid Excrements are evill alſo, and the worſt of all, and few are preſerved whoſe excrements in acute feavers are foetid, yellow, fat, black, and blew, or lead colour.</p>
                        <p>Thoſe vomitings are good which truly purge the cauſes of diſeaſes,
<note place="margin">Of vomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings.</note> or which are made critically, and when concocted matter appears on the criticall daies, and are ſuitable to the nature of the diſeaſe, and take away or abate the ſame; but on the contrary, all thoſe are evill which happen in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, when the matter is not yet concocted, and which take not away the morbifique matter, and the diſeaſe; and they are ſo much the worſe if other pernitious ſignes be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, ſuch as are ſincere Vomits, leek coloured, lead coloured, black, ſtinking, and foetid, from the guts, Ileon, and very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle.</p>
                        <p>Sweats are good which happen after decoction is made,
<note place="margin">Oſ ſweats.</note> and on a criticall day, and coldneſſe, and ſtifneſſe, proceeding &amp; flowes out hot and plentifully from the whole body, and leſſen and abate the diſeaſe: on the other ſide, thoſe are evill which happen whileſt the matter is crude, which are too much, or too little, and thoſe which are cold, or flow not from the whole body, and neither diminiſh nor take away the diſeaſe.</p>
                        <p>The Hemorodes of the noſe are good which happen in the ſtate of a diſeaſe,
<note place="margin">From the Hemerodes of the noſe.</note> with ſignes of concoction, nor is that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies to be condemned which happens in the augmentation, and alſo in the beginning, ſeeing the blood wants no other preparation, neither do the other humours. Good Hemerodes ought to be large, but yet not over much, but to be made with
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:36866:116"/>eaſe, and the ſymptomes of the Feaver to be abated, and to happen in a criticall day, and in thoſe diſeaſes, wherin blee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding is proper to their nature and condition; and moreover the blood ought to flow from a part oppoſite to the part affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted: on the contrary, thoſe are ill Hemerodes which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen in the beginning, unleſſe other good ſignes are preſent, and if they appear with dangerous ſignes, and thoſe which are too large, or too little.</p>
                        <p>Dropping of blood from the Noſe is evill, if it be cauſed by perverneſſe of matter, multitude, imbecility of force, or all theſe, eſpecially in the beginning, or on the fourth day, if the blood be black, ſincere, and without mixture: But it be a token of a future Criſis, tis no ill ſigne, which happens when the ſignes of concoction have been before, and the diſeaſe is not dangerous.</p>
                        <p>Spittle is of great uſe in ſhewing of diſeaſes of the breaſt,
<note place="margin">From ſpit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle.</note> and that is good which is concocted, white and equall, and is ſpit out conveniently, and eaſily in a ſhort ſpace of time, without great pain, and a great cough: on the contrary, tis evill if it be crude, yellow; worſe, if it be green, worſt of all if black, eſpecially if it be without mixture, if it appears more dull, and is ſpit out with great difficulty, tis alſo evill; when the ſpittle is bloody, for it proceedeth from eroſion, or from breaking of Veſſels.</p>
                        <p>Laſtly, decretory Impoſthumations are good,
<note place="margin">
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcers.</note> if they happen with ſignes of concoction, and other good ſignes, and break on a judicatory day; they are good by nature which are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved from the bowels and more noble parts, which perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere, are ſuppurated, and help the ſick: On the contrary, thoſe are evill which break forth without ſignes of conco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, the matter as yet being crude, and on a day that is not criticall, if they are too great, or too little, or happen to be in the fingers, or toes, if they are lead colour, or too red, inclining to black, and thoſe which decreaſe and vaniſh, without any reaſon, and without any precedent evacuation, thoſe which are not well ſuppurated, which are corrupted, and they bring either that part where they are, or the whole body into danger.</p>

                        <p>But if ſignes of concoction appeare the firſt and ſecond dayes, and the diſeaſe be neither benigne nor vehement, the diſeaſe may be extended, to the ſecond quarternary, but as long as ſuch ſeavers can continue the firſt day, it can ſcarce be known, but afterwards each quartarnary are to be conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and the ſignes of concoction in them are to be wieghed &amp; compared with the vehemency of the diſeaſe, towit, if in the fourth day ſignes of concoction appear in the urine, tis a ſigne that the matter is apt to be concocted, and that the diſeaſe will terminate on the ſeventh day; on the contrary, if in ſuch a feaver, on the fourth day there appeare no ſignes of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction but ill ſignes are alſo increaſed, tis an argument that
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:36866:118"/>the ſick growes worſe, and may dye about the ſeventh day; unleſſe ſome error be committed, or ſome other cauſe of change be preſent.</p>

                        <p>Again ſome are perfect and very good,
<note place="margin">Perſect. Imperſect.</note> which free the ſick perfectly and wholly from the diſeaſe, and leave none of the morbifique matter, but the imperfect leave ſome of the morbifique matter behind.</p>

                        <p>Again, ſome are faithfull and ſecure,
<note place="margin">Secure. Not ſecure.</note> which ſo take away the diſeaſe, that there is no feare of a relapſe; unfaithfull is that which leaves a doubt of falling into it again.</p>
                        <p>Moreover tis called a ſafe Criſis which happens without danger of Symptomes;
<note place="margin">A ſafe. Dangerous.</note> but a dangerous which is joyned with perilous Symptomes.</p>
                        <p>Some Criſes are with good ſignes,
<note place="margin">Euſemes.</note> and have their indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations from the daies going before them, and are called good ſignes; but that which happens without ſignes, and is,
<note place="margin">Aſemos.</note> as it were, unſeperated, is ſaid to be an ill ſigne.</p>
                        <p>But all theſe differences depend on three things,
<note place="margin">The diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences of Criſis whereon they depend</note> the ſtrength of nature, the nature of a diſeaſe, and the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the matter which ought to be expelled; and that a good and perfect Criſis be made, tis requiſite that nature be ſtrong, and Heaven favourable, the diſeaſe not dangerous, and the matter benigne and facill; in all other Criſes one, or more of theſe are wanting.</p>
                        <p>All Criſes are made two waies, either by excretion,
<note place="margin">Criſis, how many waies made. By excreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, by tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation.</note> or e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting, or elſe by removing the matter: By excretion a Criſis is made when peccant humours are expelled by vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, Seidgs, ſweat, plenty of Urine, Hemerodes of the Noſe, flowing of the months, and Hemerodes: A Criſis is made by tranſlation, when the matter is not expelled out of the body, but is removed into another place, and that either into internall parts, or externall, the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Criſis is the better, becauſe the matter for the moſt part is throughly caſt out from the center of the body; by ſo much alſo a Criſis is the better, that is made by tranſlation, by how much the matter is transferred to a more ignoble and remote place; ſo much the worſe, by how much the place is more noble and nigher to the ſeat of the former diſeaſe: An Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſthumation alſo, or Ulcer ought to be out of the region of the part affected, and to have the other notes of a good Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſthumation; an abſceſſe alſo ought not to vaniſh ſuddenly, but to remain untill either it be turned into quitture, or till it be diſſipated by degrees.</p>

                        <p>Firſt ſeeing the order of criticall daies cannot proceed on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from the faculty of the body, nor from morbifique matter,

<pb n="220" facs="tcp:36866:121"/>changings of the ſhape of the Moon are to be joyned what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever they are; yet the criſes are ſtronger when the Septina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries exactly fall into the quadrates of the Moone.</p>
                        <p>But in the computing of the criticall dayes,
<note place="margin">A periodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call month in criticall dayes to be obſerved.</note> the month of wandring or travelling is to be obſerved as being naturall and according to which many changes are made in this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior orbe, which for the moſt part is made in twenty ſeven dayes and eight hours, which if they are divided into foure weekes, the firſt will be ended, in ſix dayes and twenty hours, the ſecond in thrirteen dayes, and ſixteen hours, the third in twenty dayes and twelve hours.</p>
                        <p>Therefore on what day ſoever any one fall ſick at the firſt onſet of the diſeaſe, a conjunction as it were is made of the Moone and the diſeaſe, hence when the Moone hath meaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red three fignes, or paſt over ninty degrees, and comes to the firſt quadrate, the firſt criticall day is made; when ſhe hath paſt through ſix ſignes, or an 180. degrees ſhe comes to the oppoſite ſigne, and the ſecond criticall day begins; when from the oppoſite ſigneſhe paſſeth to the ſecond quadrate, the third criſis begins, if the diſeaſe be prolonged till then, laſtly when ſhe returns again to the place where ſhe was at the beginning of the diſeaſe the fourth criſis begins, and ſhe ſhews as ſhe did at firſt.

                        <p>But here the dayes are not to be numbered according to the diurnall indifferent motion of the Moone,

<note place="margin">The Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the deſence of health.</note> it may conveniently be comprehended in two parts; the firſt is the knowledge of thoſe things which are, as it were, the materialls of health, or the knowledge which is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of wholſome cauſes, and of things called Non-natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall.

                        <p>But the conſtitution of the Aire may be polluted through divers cauſes; firſt, the conſtitution of the Aire depends on
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:36866:125"/>the ſcituation and nature of places; for ſome Regions are hotter then others, others colder, for by how much the more any Regions receives the direct beames of the Sun, and by how much the longer the Sun remains above their Horizon, by ſo much the Country is the more hot; for the contrary reaſons tis ſo much the colder.</p>
                        <p>Yet this cauſe only doth not ſuffice,
<note place="margin">The earth and nature of the place.</note> neither is the ſame conſtitution of aire in all the inhabitants under the ſame paralell; ſecondly, the mould and proper nature of the earth conduceth to the conſtitution of the temperature of the aire, where in is to be obſerved what the nature of the ground is, fat, dirty, filthy, gravelly, ſtony, ſandy, whither the place be high or low, what ſcituation there is of mountains, and val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, what winds it often admits, and from what climates, whether the the ſea, or any lakes be neere it, whether it brings forth mettalls from whence malignant aire may be exha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.</p>
                        <p>The mountains alſo change the conſtitution of aire,
<note place="margin">Scituation of Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines.</note> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as the blowings of certain windes drive away, and admit it, and if the mountains drive away the North-wind, but admit the South, it comes to paſſe that the places are hotter and moiſter, but on the contrary if by ſcituation of the Mountains, the blowing of the South be hindred, and the North admitted the place is colder and dryer.</p>
                        <p>The winds bring forth great mutations,
<note place="margin">Winds.</note> alſo the Orientall winds are more temperate, as alſo the Occidentall, but theſe are moiſter, the Notherne are cold and dry, and have power to bind and dry our bodyes, the Southerne are hot and moiſt, therefore as the Region or ſcituation is more or leſſe diſpoſed to this or that wind, ſo it obtains this or that conſtitution of Aire: Regions, and Countryes expoſed to the Orientall Sun, are more wholeſome then thoſe which are expoſed to the Septentrionall, and hot winds; as alſo then thoſe which are expoſed to the Weſt.</p>
                        <p>The vicinity of the Sea alſo and lakes conduce much to the peculiar nature of Aire,
<note place="margin">The vicini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Sea and of lakes.</note> unleſſe interjected Mountains pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibit, for from moiſt places of this nature many exhalations are drawn up, which mingles themſelves with Aire and moiſten it, and indeed the humidity will be increaſed if the Sea or a lake be ſcituated on the South, but if towards North, the frigidity increaſe; if a lake of the Sea be Orientall, and the riſing Sun not far off, it drawes aboundance of moiſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halations to thoſe places, but if the Sun be more remote, the
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:36866:126"/>Vapours with the beams of the Sun wax hot and bring dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to that place, but leſſe moiſture comes from lakes, and waters ſcituated to the Weſt.</p>

                        <p>But Wines differ according to taſte, ſmell, colour,
<note place="margin">Differences of Wines Savour.</note> and manner of ſubſiſtance: as for what belongs to the taſte, ſweet Wines properly ſo called, nourish beſt, and are not only moſt gratefull to the palate, but to the bowells, but becauſe they are thicker, they eaſily produce obſtructions in the Liver, and Spleen, inflame the Hipocondries, and are eaſily turned into choler, they are profitable for the Lungs, Chops, and Throate, nor do they ſo hurt the head, nor offend the nerves.</p>
                        <p>Auſtere or harſh wines have the weaker heat, tarry longer in the belly, nor doe they eaſily paſſe through the veines, and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrate through the paſſages of the urine, whence they are good for a looſeneſſe of the belly, but hurtfull in diſeaſes of the breſt and Lungs, for they detaine ſpittle; the beſt wines are the middle ſort which are neither very ſweet, nor ſowre.</p>
                        <p>A fragrant ſmell is a token of the beſt Wine,
<note place="margin">Smell.</note> becauſe it can increaſe Spirits, reſtore decayed ſtrength, and recreate, and ſuddenly refreſh thoſe that are languiſhing, even by its ſmell, and can exhilerate the mind, and ſtrengthen the
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:36866:136"/>whole body and all its faculties, and principally tis good for old men, only that it fills the head, and hurts the nerves, but Wines that have no ſmell are baſe, and neither received ſo greedily by the ſtomach, nor are they ſo eaſily concocted, nor do they afford matter, nor ſo fit aliment to engender Spirits, nor do they add ſo much ſtrength to the heart, nor do they ſo much refreſh the body, but thoſe which have a ſtrange ſmell, whenceſoever contracted, are all nought.</p>
                        <p>White or pale Wines heate leſſe,
<note place="margin">Colour.</note> then full and yellow Wines, and are weaker, eſpecially if beſides their whiteneſſe they are of a thin ſubſtance, all black wines are of thicker ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and for the moſt part ſweete and nouriſh very much, yet they beget thick blood, and not ſo laudable, they cauſe obſtructions, and continue long in the bowels, and fill the head with many Vapours; between the white, and red, there are middle colours, yellow, reddiſh yellow, a pale red, and perfect red; a pale red are necreſt to the white, and if the ſubſtance be thin, are the beſt, ſuch as are Rheniſh Wines, the moſt apt to ſtrengthen the heart, and to renew ſtrength; Greek Wines alſo ſtrengthen the heart, and are beneficiall to to thoſe that are troubled with cholick paines, and with the flatus of the ſtomach; red Wines for the moſt part have not ſo great a force of heating, they generate good blood, and do not load the head, but if they are of a thicker ſubſtance, they are not ſo good for the Liver, and Spleen, by reaſon of the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions, which they occaſion; between the white, and red, is a Wine of a mixt colour, which alſo doth not heat ſo much, nor offend the head.</p>
                        <p>As for the manner of ſubſiſtence,
<note place="margin">The man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance.</note> tenuity is in the firſt place in that which is watry, hence that which is of a pale red, and yellow; craſſitude is in that which is black, red, ſweet and ſowre, and thin wines eaſily penetrate, and ſoon refreſh the ſtrength, they open paſſages, move ſweates and urine, yet they nouriſh more ſparingly, but the thick nouriſh more, and are longer detained in the parts, and heat and dry them more, and often times bring forth obſtructions.</p>
                        <p>Wines alſo differ according to age,
<note place="margin">Differences of Wines according to age.</note> new Wine is thick and flatuous, begets the cholick, impeads excretion of urine, yet it looſens the belly, and unleſſe it doth ſo, tis the more hurtfull, new Wine, and that which it as ſweet, as Wine new preſt, is not eaſily diſtributed into the body, but old Wine does work too much upon the nerves, and offend the head.</p>

                        <p>All new drink is more unwholeſome, eſpecially, if it be troubled, for it obſtructs the paſſages, and breeds the ſtone, but that which is more cleanſed is wholeſomer, but princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally, ſtrong drinkes have their faculties, from various wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of ſeverall natures.</p>

The ſtudy of health is not to be glutted with meate, nor to be ſlow to labour: and <hi>Avicenne</hi> admoniſheth us to riſe from the Table, with thoſe that are hungry; laſtly thoſe which live idely, and live a life not ſo labourious concoct leſs, thoſe which are exerciſed in labour digeſt more.</p>
                        <p>Of the time of the yeare, <hi>Hippocrates</hi> writeth, 1. <hi>Apho.</hi> 15. Their Bellies which are born in the Winter or Spring are very hot, and their ſleep tedious; therefore at thoſe ſeaſons of the yeare they ought to eate more, foraſmuch as they have more heat, whence it comes to paſſe, that they want more plentifull nouriſhment. And in the third of Diet he teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that wee ought to eate more in Winter, but drink more ſparingly, but in Summer, the contrary. But nevertheleſſe if any one either through ill cuſtome, or the allurements of meats hath any way offended herein, that afterwards is to be be corrected by faſting, or more ſparing diet, ſleep, quiet, or vomiting, and therefore tis good to omit ſupping once a week, or elſe to eate very little ſupper.</p>

<note place="margin">Facultiei of Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt.</note> yet they may conveniently be divided into manifeſt and occult; thoſe are called manifeſt which affect our ſenſes, or which excite qualities in the patient which are diſcerned by our ſenſes, and whereof a manifeſt cauſe may be rendred.</p>
                           <p>But occult are ſuch which doe not produce qualities in a Patient, obvious to ſence,
<note place="margin">Occult</note> but performe ſomething by a hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den propriety, to wit, they purge a certaine humor, they ſtrengthen a certaine member, they reſiſt poyſon, or being hung or carried externally worke upon the body, the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt cauſes whereof cannot be explained, and no other reaſon can be given, then that ſuch a power or force is in them, by a peculiar propriety of nature, although there are ſome who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject hidden qualities, yet <hi>I.

<note place="margin">The firſt the ſecond.</note> the manifeſt and occult fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties and actions of Medicines are various, of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt qualities ſome are primary, others ſecondary,

<note place="margin">The third kind of qualities.</note> the firſt have power of heating, coo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, moiſtning and drying; the ſecond to ſoften, to harden, condenſe, rarify, reſolve, attenuate, thicken, to draw, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel; the third, to provoke Urine, to cauſe and ſtay courſes, to move vomit, generate fleſh, and to breake ſtones, although the power of breaking ſtones may more fittly be attributed to the propriety of the whole ſubſtance, as beneath Cap. 17. ſhall be ſhewne.</p>
                           <p>Occult are of three kindes, for either they evacuate a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine humour by a peculiar faculty, or they have a ſympathie with a cortaine part, whence they are called cephalicks, or cardiacks, or they reſiſt poyſon.</p>

Moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver hitherto is to be referred thoſe which are accounted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the number of ſecondary qualities, ſuch as ſoften and harden, looſening, rarify and condenſe, ſtiptick, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructing, aſtringent and opening, attenuating and incraſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, filling, and deterging or cleanſing: laſtly hereunto be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs, Anodunes, Stupefactives, and Hypnoticks or ſuch as cauſe reſt.</p>
                           <p>In the ſecond forme are thoſe which prevaile in cauſing motion, attracting and repelling; to the third forme thoſe things are referred, which conſiſt in the generation of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing, ripening, generating quitture, breeding fleſh, Glu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinating, cicatrizing, and procuring milke and ſperme.</p>
                           <p>To the fourth forme are referred thoſe things which cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt, corrode, putrify, ſuch as cauſe dry cruſt, burning, and ſuch as doe corrupt ſeed and milke.</p>
                           <p>The fift forme comprehends thoſe things which belong to the taking away of any thing, ſuch things as make leſſe, ſuch as purge, ſuch as cauſe Vomiting, Urine, or ſweats, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke courſes, expel the ſecondine, or ſend forth a dead child, ſuch things as break and expell the Stone, Errhines, Sternuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories, and Apophlegmatiſmes, ſuch things as purge the breaſts, and ſuch as kill and expell Wormes.</p>

                              <p>The differences of Swathing-bands are various,
<note place="margin">Differences of it.</note> which are taken from their figure, length, and breadth, they differ in reſpect of figure, becauſe ſome are rolled up thick, long and equally broad, and rolled up into a round circle, others are rent, or broken, which conſiſts only of one linnen cloath, but that cut or parted, either in the middle or outſides, others are ſowed together, which are Swathing-bands and Ligatures ending in divers heads, and repreſenting ſeverall figures; Swadlings differ in longitude, becauſe ſome are longer, others ſhorter, and ſo it is of latitude.</p>
                              <p>There are two kinds of deligation, the one ſimple,

                              <p>The uſe of ſwathing is twofold, one by its ſelfe, which is to draw together the disjoyned parts, to contract thedilated, to direct the diſtorted, to containe the member framed and the adjunct parts, to reſiſt a humour flowing; or to repreſſe a humour which is already flowne, or to force blood to extenua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted parts; but that which begins in a place affected re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſeth from the part, that which begins from a ſound or oppoſite, forces towards the part, the other is by accident, which is to keep on medicines applyed to any part.</p>

                           <p>Every thing which jndicates ſhews the conſervation of its ſelfe, or the taking of it away.</p>
                           <p>That which is according to nature is to be preſerved, and that which is contrary to nature is to be taken away.</p>
                           <p>Contraries are cured by their contraryes, likes are preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by their likes.</p>
                           <p>But there are various differences of Indications,
<note place="margin">Differences of Indica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</note> the firſt and moſt generall is taken from things about which they are converſant, which are according to nature, and preternaturall, and it is becauſe an Indication is a perception, and inſinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the preſervation of that which is according to the
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:36866:178"/>nature, of the indicant to be performed by its likes, the other is an apprehenſion of the taking away of that which is preternaturall, to be performed by the contrary of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicant.</p>
                           <p>Moreover one Indication is genericall,
<note place="margin">Genericall</note> another ſubalter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, another ſpecificall and determinate; genericall which the common and genericall nature of the indicant ſupplyes, and which ſimply teacheth how to take away the diſeaſe, and the cauſe of a diſeaſe, and to preſerve ſtrength, but in what manner that may be performed, it doth not ſhew; ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alternate,
<note place="margin">Subalter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate. Specificall.</note> which the ſubalternate eſſence of the Indicant ſhewes, and which indeed determinates the matter more, yet not perfectly; ſpecificiall which is taken from the ſpecifique nature of the Indicant, and deſcribes the whole Indicant exactly and its remedie, and is alſo called the determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate.
<note place="margin">Profitable.</note>
                           </p>
                           <p>Thirdly one Indication is profitable, another unprofitable; profitable is that, to which ſome matter anſwers, or which indicates ſuch remedy, the matter whereof may be found out, and primarily,
<note place="margin">
                                 <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</note> and by its ſelfe can take away the diſeaſe; but unprofitable is that, which ſhews ſuch helpe, the matter whereof which can take away the diſeaſe of the firſt is not to be found.</p>
                           <p>Fourthly of Indications ſome are artificiall,
<note place="margin">Inartifici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all.</note> others inarti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiall; inartificiall is that which may be known by others and to the vulgar, as well as to the artiſt, who equally knowes the diſeaſe is to be taken away, and the ſtrength to be preſerved, but knowes not a reaſon how that may be done,
<note place="margin">Artificiall.</note> ſuch as is genericall, and ſometimes ſubalternate; but artificiall Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations are thoſe which are not known to all, but only to Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts, and require a great deale of skill that they may be known, and the Indicant, and helping things are exactly deſcribed ſuch as are ſpecificall and determinate.

                           <p>The Indicant which is taken from things according to nature is called vitall,
<note place="margin">A vitall Indicant.</note> but ſince things according to na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, are health, the cauſes of health, and the accidents of health, a vitall indicant may alſo be ſub-divided.</p>

                           <p>Namely the temperament indicates the preſervation of its ſelfe, of which, a rule; That diſeaſe which differs moſt, from the naturall ſtate, is to be cured with more vehement medicines, that which differs leſſe, is to be cured with milder. Age circumſcribes the vitallindicant, of this there is a rule alſo; By how much the more a diſeaſe recedes from the nature of the age of the ſick, by ſo much the more violent remedies tis to be cured with; by how much the leſſe, by ſo much the more gentle remedies. There is the ſame reaſon of Sex, as there is of age; as for cuſtome, thoſe things that are accuſtomed along time, although they are worſe, doe leſſe hurt, then thoſe which are un-accuſtomed, whence a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe which differs much from cuſtome, is to be oppoſed with ſtronger, that which recedes leſſe, with weaker medicines. The courſe of life for the moſt part requires the ſame as cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome.</p>

                              <hi>Idioſuncraſia</hi> ſhews that choice is to be had in Medicines.

                              <hi>Co-indicants</hi> or <hi>conſentients</hi> are thoſe,

<note place="margin">Repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants.</note> and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnants, they are thoſe which differ from other Indicants and require, and indicate another thing which is adverſe to that, which was indicated from another primary Indicant and indeed ſo that the indication thereof be to be preferred before the other, and that which was indicated from the other is to be omitted.</p>
                           <p>Thoſe are called Correpugnants,

                           <p>Laſtly, Permittents are thoſe which although they indicate contrary to that which was indicated by another, yet, they are overcome by another, as being more powerfull, ſo that they are compelled to ſuffer that which the other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwades.</p>
                           <p>From whence it is manifeſt that a Phyſitian ought to conſider not only what one Indicant perſwades, but alſo what another requires, for if all the Indicants agree, and conſpire as it were in one, that is boldly to be performed which is commanded by them, but if there be ſome diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment amongſt them, tis diligently to be weighed which of them perſwades moſt powerfully, and thoſe things which diſſent amongſt themſelves are to be valued by their ſtrength, dignity, and number. If they are equall according

                           <p>From whence it is manifeſt that if the magnitude of Indicants be even, the vitall indications are allwayes to be preferred before the reſt, and the greateſt reſpect is all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes to be had to the ſtrength, but if there be not a parity amongſt the Indicants, that is rather to be performed which is indicated from that which moſt perſwades, yet the reſt if it may be are not plainely to be neglected.</p>

                           <p>But in giving contrary things, this principle is to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, that the remedie may be given contrary to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicant, very exactly, but ſince that which is equally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary may be given two wayes, either by applying ſuch a thing once which is equivalent to the regreſſion from the naturall ſtate, or oftner by exhibiting contraries, not ſo di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly contrary at ſeverall times, the firſt kind of remedie is to be uſed in two ſorts of diſeaſes, namely in thoſe which are weake, and in thoſe diſeaſes, which are extreame, dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, but the latter way of remedie is to be uſed in thoſe diſeaſes, which aremoderate as it were the middle betwixt the extreame dangerous, and the weake diſeaſe.</p>

                           <p>But the convenient places are thoſe through which nature at other times rightly acting, evacuates what is offenſive, and indeed there are two wayes by which purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is to be appointed, the one is that by which we vomit, the other through the paunch,
<note place="margin">By vomit.</note> but by vomit thoſe humours are conveniently evacuated which are apt both in regard of the place where they reſide, and in reſpect of their own nature to be carried to the ſtomach, or ſuch as tend upward,

<note place="margin">By the paunch.</note> hence <hi>Hippo.</hi> writes 4. <hi>Apho.</hi> 6. thoſe that are leane, and eaſie to vomit are to be evacuated upwards, being carefull of the Winter. As for example, thoſe which abound with choler which tends upwards; but on the contrary thoſe which are hard to vomit, and are ſomewhat thicker, and of an indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent habit of body are to be purged downward being cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious in the Summer, becauſe they more abound with phlegme.</p>
                           <p>Moreover the time of the yeare ſhews the humour,

<note place="margin">What ſhews the fault con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning quantity. What offends in quantity.</note> and that which is diminuiſhed, may be increaſed, but ſince nothing can be ſaid to abound, unleſſe that at other times it be na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally preſent; but in the body blood only and ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements are contained which proceed from nature; blood and naturall excrements in this ſecond manner may be the cauſes of diſeaſes, as alſo milke and ſeed, and moreover the ſpirits and ſolid parts of the body, all which if they are defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient in quantity, ought to be increaſed, but if they exceed are to be deminuiſhed; naturall excrements are ſeldome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicient in quantity, but they often exceed; but ſince the ſame reaſon is of evacuating naturall excrements, which there is of the humours, in their kind preternaturall, here only we will ſpeak of taking away of blood when it abounds.</p>
                           <p>Therefore if Plethory, be preſent and the blood abound,
<note place="margin">Plethory what it ſhews.</note> the blood is to be diminuiſhed, and that which aboundeth to be taken away, and too great plenty of blood indicates diminution of the ſame.</p>
                           <p>But concerning the manner how we abate the blood,
<note place="margin">The man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bating blood.</note> ſome performe it more ſtrongly, others more weakly; fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, Sweates, Bathes, Exerciſe, Faſtings performe it more weakely; Leaches, opening of the Hemethodes, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation of courſes, Cupping-glaſles, and Scarrifications performe it more ſtrongly; but the moſt generous, and powerfull remedie here, is opening of a veine.</p>
                           <p>Frications, ſweates, Bathes, and Exerciſes, they diminu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh the blood one way, becauſe they ſtir up the heate in the body, which diſſolves and diſſipates the ſubſtance of our bodyes.</p>
                           <p>But faſting doth not evacuate by its ſelfe,
<note place="margin">Faſting.</note> but by reaſon that it takes away humours, and diminuiſheth the body, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it puts nothing in the ſtead of that which is conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by heate, and denyes neceſſary aliment to the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; but becauſe faſting evacuates the whole body equally, tis then requiſite when the humour abounding
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:36866:191"/>doth abound not in one part but in the whole body; yet ſhorter faſting firſt evacuates humours out of the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach and about the ſtomach; but becauſe faſting evacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates by degrees it is not profitable, nor ſufficient for an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication, when plenitude is ſuddenly to be abated. But tis endured when the ſtrength is powerfull, to which all other things, which prohibit faſting are to be referred, as tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perature of body, hot and dry, hot and moiſt, a thin habit of body, griping or biting in the Orifice of the ſtomach, vomiting, flux of the belly.</p>

But when they are uſed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of Phlebotomie they are applyed for ſome great fault in the blood, which indeed requires the breathing of a veine, which notwithſtanding weak ſtrength will not endure; but Cupping-glaſſes properly evacuate cutaneous blood, yet becauſe ſome of the blood which comes out of the skin is powred into the capillary veines from the great veines, in this reſpect alſo they are ſaid to evacuate the whole body: but if that evacuation be more ſparing it doth not reach the whole. And when Cupping-glaſſes evacuate by drawing, the uſe of them is moſt profitable if any revulſion be requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red at the ſame time: as for the place of applycation, if they are applyed in reſpect of the whole, they ſhould be put to the inferior parts; if in reſpect of any part, then to that part which requires this remedie; yet in thoſe that are pregnant, they are not to be exhibited to the inferior parts but rather to the Armes.</p>

                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap> a veine is not ſome one Indicate, but the matter of remedie which is profitable in many Indicates.</p>
                           <p>There are two generall benefits in the opening of a veine,
<note place="margin">The uſe of opening a veine.</note> to evacuate, blood, and by accident, whilſt it draws away the blood, the vehicle of heate, to coole; againe in evacuating it performes two things, for it both takes blood out of the body, and allwayes the cource, and violence of humours in the veines; firſt the way it both takes away the ill blood, and only diminuiſheth it offending in quantity, but the latter way it can revell, and draw back and derive the blood flowne into a part, and the blood which is flowne in whilſt it is yet moveable, can draw it to the parts neere thereunto; ſo that the opening of a veine may wholy per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme five things, namely to evacuate corrupt blood, to diminuiſh blood, to revell, derive, and refrigerate.</p>
                           <p>For firſt the vitious and putrifying blood may be eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuated by opening of a veine,
<note place="margin">Putred blood eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuated by the opening of a veine.</note> as that which is contained in veines, and they being opened it flowes out, and indeed tis moſt profitably appointed in beginning of diſeaſes, ſince nature for the moſt part in feavers uſe to drive no ſmall portion of the peccant matter to the extreames, and thoſe greater veines under the skin.</p>
                           <p>Secondly, breathing a veine is an excellent remedie to diminiſh the blood.
<note place="margin">The cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of a vtine de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinuiſheth blood and revels.</note>
                           </p>
                           <p>Thirdly, the opening of a veine is uſed for revulſion, for a veine being opened, the violence of the blood is turned and drawne back to the contrary part, and therefore tis a very efficacious remedie to ſtop flowings of humours, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the veines.</p>
                           <p>Fourthly, the opening of a veine may derive the blood, which newly flowed into the part,
<note place="margin">It derives.</note> and is not yet ſetled there, but as yet fluid; a veine being opened nigh at hand it may, I ſay drive the blood to a neighbouring part.</p>
                           <p>Fifthly,
<note place="margin">Cooles.</note> opening of a veine cooles by accident, but if diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temper

                           <p>From whence it is manifeſt,
<note place="margin">For which Indicants cutting of a veine ſerves.</note> that the breathing fo a veine may be profitable, whilſt the blood either putrifyes, and is corrupted, or offends in quantity, or flowes to any part, with violence, or oppreſſeth a part, or burnes vehemently.</p>

                           <p>Yet we may not allwayes open a veine when theſe Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cants are preſent,

<note place="margin">Default of humours according to quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</note> namely when hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours recede from their naturall ſtate in reſpect of qualities, how that is to be amended, from thoſe things which were ſpoken before of the preparation of humours, and which ſhall be ſpoken hereafter of curing of diſeaſes of intemperature, is manifeſt enough.</p>
                           <p>But the error in motion is various,
<note place="margin">In motion.</note> and humours decline from their naturall ſtate, if either they are not rightly mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that is, when they are moved thither whither they ought not, that is, when they ought to be quiet according to the Law of nature, they are moved at that time; or elſe are not moved, when they ſhould be moved; or are moved in parts or thither where they ought not to be moved; the firſt error is called the reſtraining motion, the ſecond the inciting, the third the helping, the fourth the correcting, and averting to another place.</p>
                           <p>Firſt therefore humours as they offend in motion afford one indication only, of ſtopping of motion,
<note place="margin">Humours offending in motion what they indicate.</note> of ſtaying the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of a humour, or an averting of a humour from a place, to which it flowes contrary to nature, unleſſe hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily nature unburthens it ſelfe conveniently by that meanes, or the body puts away humours that trouble it to ſome ignoble part of it, but we may ſatisfy this indication ſeverall wayes, namely if either we take away thoſe things from the humour, which are neceſſary for motion, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we draw back the ſame by force, namely, if out of what is thin and fluid we make it thick, if we ſtop the paſſages to it, and ſtraighten, and make narrow the wayes, through which it ought to flow, laſtly if we prohibit its comming, and bind the paſſages which are in the part that it may not be conveniently received, but when we cannot hinder theſe often, or it is ſufficient to ſtay a flux, we call back and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:36866:194"/>thoſe humours by force: Humours are drawn back either by reaſon of vacuity, or heat, or paine: By reaſon of vacuity, or rather evacuation humours are drawn back, which power out and evacuate them out the body through other parts, as the opening of a veine, ſcarrifications, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, flowing of courſes, Hemmerodes, purging by the Paunch, vomitings, urines, ſweats,: By heat and paine they are drawn back, by thoſe things which have power of inciting heat and paine, or have power of performing them both, as are frications, ligatures, lotions, fomentations, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicatories, cauſticks, and ſuch like.</p>
                           <p>An ſo,
<note place="margin">How many waies the motion of humors may be hindered</note> although there is one Indicant, namely a fault of the humours in motion, ſo there is one Indicate, namely, remedy hindring motion, and averting the humour from the part to which it flowes, yet the manners of performing theſe are various, namely foure, Revulſion, Derivation, Interception, and repulſion.</p>
                           <p>Revulſion,
<note place="margin">Revulſion, what.</note> which the Greeks cal <hi>Antiſpaſis,</hi> is an averting of a humour flowing into ſome part, into the contrary; But humours are Revelled, not thoſe which are in the affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed part (for theſe are properly evacuated out of the part affected,
<note place="margin">Revulſion ought not to be to the next.</note> or nigh thereunto) but they are ſuch as do flow to ſome part, or are about to flow. But ſince this is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to every Revulſion, that a contrary motion may be occaſioned for the flowing humour, and may move it to a part, not to that whither it tends, but to a contrary; hence it followes, that Revulſion ought not to be to the next, but to the remote and oppoſite parts, and principally accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to length, and breadth. As for the other oppoſitions ſome obſerve them alſo, whileſt they make a twofold Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſion, the one which is ſimple and abſolutely ſuch, or a univerſall Revulſion as it is called,
<note place="margin">Univerſall.</note> which obſerves con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariety in reſpect of the whol body, &amp; in it regards contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry termes, from whenceſoever the humours flow, as when we revell from the head to the leggs and feet.
<note place="margin">Particular.</note> But there is another particular Revulſion, or locall, which in one member onely regards contrary termes and oppoſition of the parts of the ſame member, and in the ſame member revels from the anterior parts to the poſterior, or from the hinder to the former parts: Which nevertheleſs ſcarce de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, the name of a Revulſion: And this former in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of diſeaſes, when the body is as yet very full, is moſt proper: But the latter is not convenient in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:36866:194"/>of diſeaſes; alſo whereas in revulſion the flowing humour ought to be drawne to the contrary part is manifeſt, flowings are to be drawn back together to the beginning; hence when humours flow from the whole body, or the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings of fluxes lye hid, the revulſion is fitly made to the remote parts, but when the beginning of the flux is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, to that the flux is to be re-called, although it be not the remoteſt part.</p>
                           <p>In particular, as for the revulſion by opening of a veine,
<note place="margin">Revulſion by opening a veine.</note> although that alſo is to be appointed in a diſtant, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote place, yet not ſimply the moſt remote part is to be choſen for the opening of a veine, but that part which is exactly on the contrary, or which alſo hath communion of veines joyned to it, or Euthyory which is a certaine di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of veſſells, by which the reduction of humours may conveniently be made, and may eaſily flow from one part into another, and therefore veines, which are open for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſion ſake, rather communicate with the part ſending, then receiving, as it is neceſſary; ſo we recall blood flowing to the place from whence it begins, and we cauſe a contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry motion for it; namely we ought here to chooſe veines which are remote to the part affected, and have communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with the part ſending, which are directly oppoſite to the part affected, either according to longitude, or latitude, hence an inferior part being affected, a veine in the Arme of the ſame ſide, a ſuperior part being affected a veine in the Arme of the contrary ſide, the liver affected the interior veine of the right cubit is to be opened.</p>
                           <p>As for the Adminiſtration of a Revulſion,
<note place="margin">The right Adminiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of revulſion.</note> the quantity of revulſion anſwers to the quantity of the flux, and ſtrength tollerating, but that is greater which is made with the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting out of a humour, then that which is without it, and there are certaine degrees and differences of magnitude in every kind, every one whereof anſwers to the certaine error in the motion of the peccant humour.</p>
                           <p>As for the time of flowing ſince revulſion ought to be of humours flowing, tis principally to be adminiſtred,
<note place="margin">The time.</note> when the flux begins, but if the flux be more laſting, it ought to be exhibited after the beginning alſo; but if the flux be leſſe ſo that it may be ſtopt by derivation, or repulſion, there is no need of revulſion.</p>
                           <p>The places, to which revulſorie remedies are applyed,

And a cold diſeaſe in a
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:36866:197"/>body hot by nature, requires hotter remedies: A moiſt diſeaſe in a dry body, and hard by nature, requires exceeding dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Medicines: A dry diſeaſe in a moiſt body, and ſoft, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires things that moiſten exceedingly.

                           <p>Alſo ſith hence in the cure of ſimple diſtempers, Simple contrary Medicines do beſt agree, if they are not alwaies in a readineſs, that quality which doth not agree, or which is hurtfull may be taken away by the mixture of others; As on the contrary compound diſtempers, if we cannot have a Medicine which is convenient for the compound contrary qualities, that which is wanting muſt be ſupplied by the mixture of others.</p>

                           <p>Paine indicates a medicine taking away or mittigating paine,

Three kinds of meaſures of liquid things are uſed; namely, ſome for meaſuring of Wine and diſtilled Waters, others are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for Honey, others for meaſuring of Oile; all which meaſures, although they are diſtinguiſhed by the names of Ounces, yet the weight of liquid things varie in the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction of ounces: for ſince Oile is light, more of it goes to an ounce, Wine ſince tis heavier then Oile, leſſe of it goes to an ounce; Honey ſince it is heavier, then both, a ſmall quantitie, in compariſon of the other, makes an ounce.</p>

                           <p>AS for what belongs to operations,
<note place="margin">The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of heate.</note> and performances, ſince all Apothecaries whatſoever have need of heat and fire, as being the moſt common and uſefull Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, firſt let us treat of heare.</p>
                           <p>But in heate in the firſt place, the degrees thereof are to be conſidered and the manners, of adding of fire; the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of heate in generall and abſolutly are accounted foure; The Firſt is that which appears pleaſing and milde or gentle; the Second is that which is quicker and allmoſt not to be endured by the hand; the Third deſtroyes, the Fourth is the higheſt: but every of theſe degrees have a great latitude, and therefore not undeſervedly every degree may be divided againe into its degrees, in rightly ſhewing wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of much diſcretion is required, but for the moſt part tis bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to erre in defect, then in exceſſe, for if any thing be once corrupted by the violence of the fire, it cannot be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored to its ſelfe againe, and oftentimes glaſſes are corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and other dangers are accumulated, but if there be any error in defect, by continnance and increafing the degree of heate, it may be recompenced, although the time of operation be prolonged.</p>
                           <p>But the degrees of heate may be made up divers wayes,
<note place="margin">How they may be va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried.</note> and depend on divers cauſes, the cheife whereof we will propound. For firſt fire may be uſed divers wayes and manners, for ſometimes the matter with a fit veſſell, or without a veſſell, naked and open, is put to the fire, which again is done ſeverall wayes, for either it is circular, which in plaine incompaſſeth the veſſells and is removed from a diſtant place by degrees neerer to the veſſell, untill at length, 'tis heaped up over the veſſell, or elſe the veſſells are put in a fit furnace or the fire is made above the veſſel <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verberatory,</hi> or ſtriking back when the flame is repercuſſed by the cover, or doore of the furnace, it ſtrikes as it were the matter, and ſo it flyes round every way.</p>
                           <p>At other times the matter with its veſſell is not expoſed to the open fire,
<note place="margin">A dry Bath.</note> but is ſetagainſt another body intervening, and that divers wayes; for firſt, if a pot to put ſand or ſuch
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:36866:211"/>like matter into, put on a veſſell ſtanding on a Trivet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the matter to be prepared, be empty, tis moſt conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niently called a dry Balneum or a dry Stupha, but if the veſſell be not empty, a various heate according to the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of matter which is put in it, may be afforded, and may be called by ſeverall names; if it be filled with water and the veſſell together with the matter to be diſtilled, be ſet into the water; it is ſimply called <hi>Balneum Maris</hi> or <hi>Mariae;</hi>
                              <note place="margin">Balneum Maris.</note> a Bath alſo may be prepared not only of water but of the ſaw-duſt of ſawed wood or Hay filling the veſſell and then moiſtning it, and ſo cover it with a glaſſe, but if the veſſell with the matter to be elaborated be not ſet in water, but be ſo placed, that it may receive only the vapour of the heated water, it is called <hi>Balneum Vaporoſum,</hi> afterwards let the pot be filled with the duſt of Bricks, with Sand, Saw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſt, the filings of Iron and ſuch like.</p>
                           <p>Secondly, the moderation or governing of the heate, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends on the ſtore of fuell, the quantity whereof in the kindled coales, the Artiſt can at pleaſure abate or increaſe, or make it how he pleaſe, and that either by the plenty or want of coales, or by the more free eventilation of Aire, and the ſhutting out interception of the ſame; for a greater quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of coales make a greater and ſtronger heate, if they can by the fuming of the Aire, and by opening of breathing holes, be kindled, all which may be better ſhewne then deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed.</p>
                           <p>Thirdly, for the variation of the fire, the diſhes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly called <hi>Cappellae</hi> do make it according to their various diſtance from the fier; for if they are moved neerer to the fier it is increaſed, but if further off, the heate is remitted.</p>

<pb n="422" facs="tcp:36866:212"/>and to comprehend them in the three following Chapters, In the firſt we may contain thoſe operations which pertain to the diſſolution and corruption of a thing; In the ſecond we will put in thoſe things which are ſeparated, and the detra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of any thing, In the third, we will explain thoſe which are appointed for the alteration, immutation, perfection, and preſerving of a thing.</p>
                           <p>In the the firſt rank are breaking, or grinding, ſhaving, ſleeking, filing, melting, or diſſolving, drayning, burning, turning into aſhes, or incineration, calcination, praecipita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, fumigation, putrifaction and fermentation.</p>
                           <p>As for breaking or grinding,
<note place="margin">Tritura.</note> the chief end thereof is, that things may reduced into their ſmalleſt parts; that afterwards they may the eaſier, and more exactly be mixt with others, and their vertue may be drawn out.</p>
                           <p>Sleeking,
<note place="margin">Laeviga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio.</note> or levigation, is nothing elſe then a moſt exact breaking or grinding, whereby ſome Medicine, red marble, or ſome other polite ſtone, a convenient liquor being powred in, or elſe without liquor, tis ſo long wrought with a little kind of Mil ſtone, by the turning of the hand, that it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced into the form of fine flower, and wonderful ſmal duſt, in that manner painters uſe to prepare their colours.</p>
                           <p>Next to theſe are Section, Shaving, and Filing: Leaves, Staulks and rootes of plants,
<note place="margin">Cutting Shaving Filing</note> are cut with Scizzers, or Knives, and by this means they are prepared, for boyling, infuſion, or grinding, other things are ſhaved, or leſſened by a turn, as woods, horns, hoofs, or nails, teeth of living creatures, for the ſame purpoſes. But thoſe things which can neither be leſſened by cutting or breaking, ſhould be filed with an iron File, and reduced into the ſmalleſt parts, ſuch like are moſt met<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals, as iron, and others, and alſo woods, horns, and bones of Animales.</p>
                           <p>Melting is a reduction of harder things,
<note place="margin">Meltings Diſſolving.</note> into a more liquid ſubſtance. Diſſolving differs not from this, unleſſe becauſe that is done alwaies by the benefit of heat, and for the moſt part without adding of moiſture; but this is alwayes done with moiſture, and oftentimes without heat, ſo they melt fat, butter, marrow, wax, Pirch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                              </gap>oſin, certain kinds of gummes, as alſo mettals by a greater ſtrength of fire, but for the moſt part with powder added that they may the better run; all kinds of ſalt, are diſſolved teares, juices, many kinds of gummes, Roſins.</p>
                           <pb n="423" facs="tcp:36866:212"/>
                           <p>Drayning or diſſolving is a peculiar ſort of ſolution when a body is made fluid, by moiſt aier,
<note place="margin">Deliqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um.</note> which inſinuates it ſelf into it, ſo ſalts, allome, nitre, and ſuch like melt, all which turn into liquor, alſo lyme, or chaulke, of which the greateſt part are diſſolved into liquor, or ſome thing of them onely melt, according as they contain more or leſs ſalt. To theſe belong burning, and torrifying,
<note place="margin">Burning. Toaſting:</note> yet they differ in this, that theſe are performed with the leſſe, they with the greater fire, whence, in toſting things are rather dryed, then burnt, and if any thing be burnt, tis the out-ſide, but in burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as well the internal parts, as thoſe on the outſide are burnt together. This drying is performed in a Platter, or Frying pan, eſpecially of iron, wherein medicines put to the fire may often be ſtirred about, that either the ſuperfluous hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miditie may be conſumed, or the qualitie that abounds in the medicine may be taken away, but burning, when any medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine, as harts horn, mans skull, ivory, oils incloſed in a pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters furnace, are burnt, and being burnt, and as yet hot are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed in a convenient liquor, and afterward rubbed, or crumbled to duſt.</p>
                           <p>Cinefaction, or a reduction into aſhes,
<note place="margin">Burning to askes.</note> is ſo called when the moiſture, which was in the combuſtible matter, by which the parts hung together, is conſumed by the fire, which is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, two wayes; Firſt, the fire being opened the thing it ſelf is caſt in naked, and is reduced into aſhes, moreover in a Veſſel that is cloſed, matter is burnt and turned into aſhes, which combuſtion differs from the former in this, for in the former, whatſoever is volitile flyes into the ayer, but in this ſome volitiles are retained, and faſtned with the fixed.</p>
                           <p>Calcination is a pulveriſation of a thing by fire cauſed by the privation of the moiſture of the part joyned with it.
<note place="margin">Calcining.</note> This principally takes place in minerals, and mettals, and other things which of themſelves do not burn, and are more firmely united, and tis appointed either that a thing may be made the fitter for ſolution, or to loſe the acrimony, which it hath, although on the contrary ſome things become the ſharper for burning whilſt the aqueous humiditie, whereby the acri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony is occaſioned is conſumed by fire. But this is perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed two wayes, either by actual fire, when things are fired, and the bond of continuitie is broken by actual fire; or by poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial fire, when things to be calcined, are corroded, by ſtrong and corraſive waters, and other cauſticks.</p>
                           <pb n="424" facs="tcp:36866:213"/>
                           <p>That calcination, which is made by actuall fire is againe various, for ſome things are calcined by themſelves, and without any addition, but other things, with additamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents, which either prohibit the fuſion, or elſe burne and corrode.</p>
                           <p>But that calcination in particular, which is made and corraſive powders mixt therewith,
<note place="margin">Cementing.</note> is called Cementing, and tis performed when a crucible is filled with thin plates of mettall, and corraſive powders, one ranke above ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Firſt Plates, then Powders, then Plates, then pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, &amp;c. As the manner is in doing, after the crucible is expoſed to a circular fire or Reverberation by degrees, yet ſome things are extinguiſhed firſt by certaine waters, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are calcined, ſome are corroded firſt by their own waters and afterwards are Reverberared; on the contrary ſome things are Reverberated firſt, afterwards corro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</p>
                           <p>Calcination which is done by potentiall fire is finiſhed by corroding,
<note place="margin">Corroding.</note> precipitating, or Fumigation. Corroſion is a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of mettalls, or ſuch like by waters and ſharpe ſpirits Precipitation is when a mettall deſcends to the bottome,

                           <p>Hitherto pertaines Amalgamation,

                           <p>Laſtly putrifaction, which others call Fermentation, and digeſtion, is that operation whereby a mixt body is ſomeway diſſolved by a moiſt heate, and loſing its natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall juncture, or Union, is rendred the more fit for artificial ſeperation.</p>

                           <p>Diſtillation is nothing elſe,
<note place="margin">Diſtilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> but a collection of exhalations elevated by heat, out of ſomething exhalable, by the help of a Veſſel, and receptacle, thick, and cold into a liquour.</p>
                           <p>This is commonly accounted threefold, the one is that which is by aſcent, the other is that which is made by the ſides, the third is that which is made by deſcent.</p>
                           <p>By aſcent Diſtillation is ſaid to be,
<note place="margin">Diſtilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent.</note> when the exhalations and vapours aſcend upward, from the Alembick, or the head of the Furnace. And the Veſſels which contain the matter to be diſtilled, the head being put on in it, tis condenſed into a liquour, which diſtills drop by drop through the beak or noſe into the receiver, and it is gathered together. This is performed, either by the Sun beams or by fire, ſometimes ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing open, ſometimes not manifeſt, namely ſome other body intervening, as ſand, aſhes, water, &amp;c.</p>
                           <p>Hitherto alſo may be referred conveniently Diſtillation by a Glaſſe like a ball ſo called,

<note place="margin">Diſtilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the ſides.</note> or elſe it is called by inclination, when the exhalation, and ſpirits do not aſcend ſtraight up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards in the Alembick, but tend towards the receiver by the ſides and obliquely, This is performed either when the fire is opened to it, or when ſome other body comes between, as ſand, aſhes, &amp;c. By a Veſſel which they call a Retort, or a
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:36866:214"/>Straight gourd, yet placed oblique in the furnace, that the Alembick may incline downwards.</p>
                           <p>Diſtillation by deſcent is when a liquour,
<note place="margin">Diſtilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by deſcent.</note> is not carried upwards, from the diſſolved exhalations, nor to the ſides; but tends downwards, and drops into the ſuppoſed Veſſel. This again is performed, the Veſſel lying immediatly on the fire, or ſand, aſhes, &amp;c. intervening.</p>
                           <p>To diſtillations belongs Rectification, or Cohobation,
<note place="margin">Rectifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> whereof that is no other then a repeated diſtillation of a thing, to purifie and exalt it the more, the dreggs being left in the bottome, or to ſeperate the phlegme from oil, or the ſpirit from phlegme, but this is ſaid, when the humour which was diſtilled, is powred off, and again, and again, is drawn, and diſtilled in the ſame Veſſel, where the matter was left.</p>

<note place="margin">Sublima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> which is performed ſometimes by fire that is open, ſometimes by ſome intervening body, as Sand, Aſhes, &amp;c.

                           <p>Praecipitation ſeems to be contrary to this,
<note place="margin">Praecipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</note> which is done when bodies diſſolved by waters and corroding liquours, are again ſeparated from the liquour, that the form of chaulk or duſt may remain, which commeth to paſſe, when any thing is caſt or powred into the ſolution, by whoſe force the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving liquour, or that which was the cauſe of ſolution in the liquor, is ſeperated from the diſſolved body.

                           <p>By Exſiccation the ſuperfluous moiſture is taken away, whether in the ſhade, or in the Sun, or whether it be done in an Oven, or in a Frying-pan over Coales, both for that the Medicines may the better be preſerved, and may not contract thirſt by their ſuperfluous humidity, and putrifie, and be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, and alſo, that they may the eaſier be contained, and made into powder.</p>
                           <p>By Evaporation the aqueous humidity expires,
<note place="margin">Evapora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

                           <p>Aromaticks, and other ſimples being beaten into a fine powder. In the firſt place clarified honey is put into it, or ſugar, or ſome convenient waters, or ſyrups, or proper de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coctions of proper ſimples in faire water, or a ſufficient quantity of another liquor, or infuſions, or juyces preſt out of other Medecines ſtrained and boyled with clarifyed ſugar, or honey, to the conſiſtence of a ſyrup, or of many of theſe together, whileſt they are as yet warme by the fire. A third part is ſprinkled in by little and little, which may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniently be done through a Sieve, and is to be ſtirred a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout with a woodden Peſtle in a Morter, and ſhould be exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mingled and kept in a convenient Veſſell.</p>
                           <p>The other manner is thus, Conſerves they are convenient for your preſent purpoſe, to which are added powders, and Aromatick Species, Troches, Conſerves alſo, and medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cionall juyces, or Robs muſt be exactly mixt together in a Morter, with a ſufficient quantity of diſſolved ſugar, or a convenient ſyrup, or honey: But the proportion betwixt the Conſerves and Powders, and Species are not ſo exact, as ſome do determine, but ſeverall times they may be three fold, foure fold, ſix fold, eight fold, twelve fold: For a ſufficient quantity of a convenient ſyrup being poured in, whatſoever the proportion be betwixt it and the Powders, they may be all reduced eaſily into the conſiſtence of an Electuary, which is alſo to be held of Conſerves. Sometimes alſo ſpirit of
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:36866:228"/>Roſes, of Salt, of Vitrioll, diſtilled waters compounded, or of diſtilled Oyles, ſome drops are to be put in. And theſe kinds of Electuaries were called by ſome Condites, as is ſaid before, tis ſo called by ſome from the mixture.
<note place="margin">Mixture.</note> Purging E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectuaries for the moſt part are ſo made.</p>
                           <p>There is another manner like to this: Fruits, ſeeds, or roots are put in, or are boiled in wine or water, to the f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           <p>Purging confections alſo are prepared,
<note place="margin">Of purging Comſits.</note> and that two wayes, firſt if the Sugar be poured in before it be cooled, the purging things are mingled, and ſtird about together that they may ſtick to the Sugar; Secondly, which is more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient, if the ſeeds, or Rindes, are macerated in a purging infuſion, untill they ſwell, and then being gently dryed are hardned with Sugar.</p>

                              <hi>Glandes,</hi> with the Greeks, <hi>Ballanoi,</hi> commonly Suppoſiters, are ſolid Medicines, which are put into the Fundament, in figure ſomewhat long and round, like to an Akorn or Wax-candle, four or five fingers breadth in length.</p>
                           <p>But Suppoſiters are not always prepared for the ſame-uſe,
<note place="margin">

                           <p>Suppoſiters irritating the expulſive faculty are exhibited, firſt, when the ſick is ſo weak that he cannot take Clyſters; moreover when the Seige clings in the Paunch, there is need of a Suppoſiter to be uſed before a Clyſter, that it may make way for the Clyſter. Thirdly, if Clyſters injected do
<pb n="469" facs="tcp:36866:235" rendition="simple:additions"/>not work, or operate ſlowly, 'tis needfull to ſtimulate nature to expulſion. Fourthly, when by reaſon of ſtraightneſs of time we cannot prepare a Clyſter.</p>
                           <p>There are three ſorts of theſe Suppoſiters,

                           <p>They are prepared in this manner,
<note place="margin">Manner of preparing them.</note> Honey is boiled to ſpiſſitude, that is, ſo long till you can take it up with your fingers; into which other things are ſprinkled which are needfull, namely, half a Drachm or a Drachm of common Salt, Salt-<hi>Gemmae</hi> a Scruple, of the gentler purging <hi>Species</hi> a Drachm, of the ſtronger half a Scruple, of Juices half a Scruple, (or a Drachm,) of ſharp Salts ſix Grains, or half a Scruple to an Ounce of Honey.

                           <p>Theſe Suppoſiters are properly applied to thoſe who have Ulcers, Clefts, Inflammations, and other Tumours in the Fundament. But when they are troubled with pain of the Hemerhoids they are not convenient to be uſed, for they exaſperate pain.</p>

                           <p>A Clyſter is injected for ſeveral ends,

Some cleanſe, namely, thoſe which are compounded of Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley, the herb Mercury, Pellitory, Wormwood, Agrimony, Century the leſs, Peaſe, Parſnibs, Lupines, Flour, Honey with Roſes, Hiera.

Sometimes Clyſters are made of Anodyns, or Medicines that mitigate pain, for pains of the Guts and Reins.</p>
                           <p>But Clyſters are compounded in this manner, there are taken of Roots and Rindes an ounce or two, of Leafs three, four or five handfuls, of Seeds three, four or five Drachms: of Flowers ſome Pugils, of Fruits, Pears ten, that is, twenty; to which if a purging Clyſter ought to be made, Purgers are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, Agrick, Colloquintida, Seeds of Carthamons, (all which leaſt they ſhould ſtickto the Guts, and offend them, are tied in a Linnen-cloath) the Leafs of Senna; but there is no need of ſuch variety always, but oftentimes a few ſimples ſuffice. All the ſimple Medicines are boiled in a ſufficient quantity of water; of the Decoction take three, four to fifteen Ounces, according to the age, for infants three Oun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, hence thoſe that are a little riper four, five or ſix may ſuffice; for one that is come to ripeneſs of years, for the

In the Decoction ſtrained thoſe things which agree to our preſent purpoſe, we diſſolve, as Oyls from an Ounce to two or three. When we onely are to emolliate, we put in Oyls onely or Butter, but indeed in greater quantity: thoſe which have a purging faculty are then wholly to be omitted, leſt by reaſon of the hard ordure ſticking in the Guts, nature ſhould be ſtimulated in vain, and humours be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing drawn greater evils do enſue. On the contrary, when you are to purge, to repell, and a ſharp Clyſter is required, the Oyls whereby the force of ſharp and purging things is reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, are to be omitted, and purging Electuaries are to be added for the moſt part double the weight, which at other times they uſe to be taken in at the mouth, or Pills are to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved, Salt alſo is to be added from a Scruple to a Drachm; alſo Abſtergents, as Honey of Roſes, or Sugar, in weight an Ounce or an Ounce and half; all of them being mixt, and moderately heated by a convenient and known inſtrument, they are to be injected into the Paunch an hour or two be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore meat.</p>
                           <p>Thoſe who are unwilling to have it done by others may give a Clyſter, as they call it, to themſelves by inſtruments deſcribed in many places, the moſt convenient whereof <hi>Guil.

                  <head>To the <hi>Reader,</hi> HEALTH <hi>and</hi> SAFETY.</head>
                  <p>WOnder not Reader, that you ſee theſe Rarities in the Engliſh Tongue, written by the learned Profeſſor of Phyſick, D. <hi>Sennertus;</hi> neither be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry that the Myſteries of this Noble Art are laid open for the unlearned to peruſe, for ſuch I deſign them. The antient Greeks as <hi>Hippocrates, Galen,</hi> &amp;c. and the Arabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, as <hi>Avicen, Averoes, Meſue, Serapio,</hi> &amp;c. wrote all in their own genuine lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, as <hi>Celſus, Serenus,</hi> and other La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines alſo in their vernacular and mother Tongue.</p>
                  <p>The Author teacheth the knowledge of thoſe diſeaſes that reigne amongſt us, and the cure of all ſorts of Fevers, continued and intermittent (which are called Agues) he ſhews the way to cure the Small Pox, nay the Peſtilence or Plague it ſelf, when it is never ſo contagious.</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:36866:253"/>
                  <p>Kind Reader, I wiſh thee no greater happineſs in time of ſickneſs, then this Book to adviſe thee, where an able Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitian is wanting; I hope it will find acce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptance by thee, and be both welcom and profitable to thee. For my part, as I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect no thanks, nor deſire no commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſo I fear no ignominy or calumnia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. May it prove as beneficial to all that read it in this Tongue, as he deſires it may that writes it; for ſeriouſly, he aſſures the world, that all true Chriſtians Lives are as dear to him as his own; and their health deſired moſt candidly by him, that eſteemeth and valueth nothing ſo much as the publique good of his Brethren.</p>
                  <p>Not long ſince, this Authors five Books of <hi>Inſtitutions of Phyſick and Chyrurgerie,</hi> were publiſhed in the Engliſh Tongue; which incomparable Piece I recommend to thy ſerious peruſal, as the beſt founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for Practiſe) that any man hitherto hath laid; Without any further troubling of thee with theſe Epiſtolary lines, I refer thee to the Book it ſelf; and ſo Farewel.</p>

                     </head>
                     <p>THat which is called by the Latines a Fever,
<note place="margin">The name. of a Fever</note> by the Greeks (from fire) is called the fiery di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper; <hi>Hippocrates</hi> plainly calls it fire, if it be very vehement, as being by the conſent of all men a hot diſtemper; For although ſome Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans call it <hi>Daskalte,</hi> yet that appellation belongs not to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Fever, neither doth it expreſs the nature of a Fever, but only ſignifieth Cold, An intermitting Fever may be ſo called.</p>
                     <p>A Fever is a hot diſtemper of the whole body, atiſing from heat, kindled contrary to nature in the heart,
<note place="margin">Its defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and nature.</note> and by the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation of the Blood and Spirits, conveyed through the veins and arteries to all the parts, and hindring natural actions, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs it be prevented.</p>
                     <p>For a Fever is generated, when (as <hi>Galen</hi> 1. Aphor. 14. hath it) The native heat is become fiery;
<note place="margin">Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it.</note> For ſeeing that all the parts of the body have a certain temperature, and all of them are actually hot, every one according to its own degree, and thereby are rendered fit to perform natural actions; If
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:36866:255"/>in the heart, from whence the vital heat is diffuſed over all the parts of the body, each part receiving its due temper from thence, a certain preter-natural heat be kindled and ſpread o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the whole body, ſo that to the natural temperature of the parts ſome degrees of preter-natural heat are added, and that actual heat ſhall be increaſed; a certain exceſs of heat and a hot diſtemper is kindled in the whole body, which is called a Fever. Which diſtemper indeed <hi>formaliter,</hi> as ſome ſay, is contrary to nature, and is called a Fever; but <hi>materialiter</hi> 'tis not altogether contrary to nature, for unleſs there had been before ſome degrees of natural heat extant, the ſuperveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent heat could not conſtitute this degree of heat.</p>
                     <p>And indeed a hot diſtemper only conſtitutes a Fever;
<note place="margin">Drineſs is no part of the Eſſence of a Fever.</note> for although all fevouriſh heat tend to drineſs, yet that drineſs is not ſickneſs in all Fevers, neither is the body by fevouriſh heat rendred unfit to perform its natural actions, it is ſo by dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in every Fever that the natural actions are hindred; but although the fevouriſh heat always tend to drineſs, yet often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the diſpoſition of the body wherein that heat acteth, and moiſture therewithal, hinders the production of a diſeaſe by drineſs.</p>
                     <p>The adequate Subject of a Fever is the whole body,
<note place="margin">The Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.</note> or cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly moſt of its parts, but the principal is the heart, as being that wherein that heat is firſt kindled, and from thence communicated to all the other parts of the body, unleſs it be hindred; nor can a Fever be generated, unleſs the heart firſt become hot. Indeed the whole body is the Subject of a Fever in regard of the ſimiliar parts, and as it is indued with actual heat, which is as it were kindled by the innate and influent heat; For this heat when it is changed and converted into a fiery heat from a temperate and moderate, a Fever is ſtirred up.</p>
                     <p>The immediate cauſe of a Fever is heat kindled in the heart contrary to nature,
<note place="margin">The proxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate cauſe.</note> and diffuſed over all the body; For as the heart whileſt it is well and according to nature, is the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of natural heat, and diſperſeth the ſame over all the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, ſo if it grow hot contrary to nature, it diſtributes that unnatural heat over all the parts. For although a Fever may be kindled by the inflamation of other parts likewiſe, yet that happens not unleſs that heat be firſt ſent to the heart, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards from thence to all the parts of the body, whence it comes to paſs that in every Fever the Pulſe is changed. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs every kind of heat in the heart is not ſufficient to
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:36866:255"/>cauſe a Fever, but ſuch a kind of heat it ought to be, as can cauſe ſuch a hot diſeaſe as can hinder the performance of natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral actions.</p>
                     <p>Whence 'tis manifeſt that a Fever is one thing,
<note place="margin">A Fever and feve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh heat differ.</note> and a fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouriſh heat another thing. A Fever properly is that hot di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper which happens in the living parts of a body, and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders them unable to act; but the fevouriſh heat is alſo in the humors and ſpirits, and ſtirrs up that hot diſtemper of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, which conſtitutes the eſſence of a Fever.</p>

                     <p>ALthough there is but one only cauſe of a hot diſtemper of the whole body, which conſtitutes the eſſence of a Fever, namely, preter-natural heat kindled in the heart, and thence diſtributed over all the body, yet the cauſes from whence that heat in the heart ariſeth, are ſeveral, as <hi>Galen</hi> of the cauſes of diſeaſes, cap. 2. and in the firſt book of differences of diſeaſes, cap. 3. recites five, Motion, Putrefaction, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tact of ſome hot thing, Cloaſure of the pores of the skin, or a Retention of a hot ſtream; and laſtly Mixture with ſome hot thing: And of theſe cauſes, ſome by themſelves, and ſome by accident ſtir up heat.</p>
                     <p>Firſt from Motion,
<note place="margin">Motion.</note> ſithence the Spirits and humours of our bodies are hot, from the confluence of them into any part, according to the various motion of the body and mind, heat is increaſed, which if it be greater, and be either kindled in the heart, or communicated to the heart, a Fever enſueth.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Putrefaction excites heat.
<note place="margin">Putrefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</note> For ſince all things that do putrifie become hotter, and out of putred bodies are exalted many hot vapours, thence heat is conveyed to the heart by the veins and arteries, and from thence a Fever raiſed.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, contact of a hot thing exciteth a Fever:
<note place="margin">Contact of a hot thing.</note> As if the body wax hot by the Sun, Fire, Bath, or Medicine, and that heat be ſent to the heart a Fever followeth.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, if the pores of the skin are cloſed, and a hot ſtream and hallituous excrements,
<note place="margin">Retention of a hot ſteam.</note> which in concoction are genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the body, and uſe to be ſent out through the pores of the skin, be penn'd in, heat is thereby kindled, and a Fever bred.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, when hot things are mingled with humours and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, as meat, drink, hot Medicines, all thoſe communicate
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:36866:256"/>that heat which they contained in themſelves to the Spirits and humours, which if they penetrate the heart, and from thence be diſtributed to the other parts of the body, a Fever is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by kindled.</p>
                     <p>And indeed the fourth of theſe cauſes, or the retention of the hot <hi>effluvium,</hi> is ſufficient alone without the reſt to cauſe a Fever: But the other cauſes without this can hardly do it. For although from Motion, Putrefaction, Contact, and Mixture with a hot thing, hot vapours are ſtirred up in the body; yet if the body freely ventilate, and that ſo much be daily evaporated and emitted of thoſe vapours as are generated, a Fever is not eaſily occaſioned, but when thoſe vapours are detained, a Fever is ſoon kindled.</p>
                     <p>But although theſe cauſes if they be powerful,
<note place="margin">Diſpoſition of a body to a Fever.</note> may raiſe a Fever in any body whatſoever, yet in bodies inclinable an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary power in the cauſes may ſuffice to beget a Fever. Now they are moſt inclinable to Fevers which abound with much heat, ſalt and ſharp humours: For which reaſon Youths are more apt to Fevers, of which you may read, <hi>Galen</hi> 8 Of the Method of healing, cap. 8. where the whole order of Inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to Fevers are ſet down. 1. Hot and dry. 2 hot and moiſt. 3. hot only. 4. dry only. 5. temperate. 6. cold and dry. 7. cold only. 8. moiſt only. 9. cold and moiſt. Yet to another kind of Fevers other bodies are more inclinable.</p>

Such action ſince it is Nutrition, and thoſe that are ſubſervient thereunto, they are eſpecially hurt in Fevers. Yet becauſe the Inſtruments by which other actions are performed, conſiſts of ſimilar parts, that imperfection is derived to the hinderance of them, as of vital and animal acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Indeed the vital actions are principally hurt in a Fever, becauſe the fevouriſh heat is firſt kindled in the heart. Whence in all Fevers the Pulſe becomes more frequent and ſwifter; for ſince the motion of Pulſes in all Fevers may be increaſed,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:36866:256"/>firſt, a thick Pulſe, as being moſt facile of all; but if that fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quency ſatisfies not the neceſſity, celerity happens, which if that be not ſufficient, then magnitude follows: So that the ſtrength be not debilitated: The animal actions alſo are often hurt. As for other Symptomes, preter-natural heat is obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to offend internally or externally. Alſo the excrements and qualities of a body are variouſly changed by reaſon of the hinderances of concoctions.</p>

Moreover the heat o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>But thoſe are the moſt proper differences which are taken from inherence in the Subject, and the cauſe of inhering, which Fevers are divided into <hi>Ephemeraes,</hi> putred and hectick, the trueſt foundation of which diviſion is, that one Fever is in habitude, the other in habit, for although the fevouriſh heat in every Fever poſſeſs the ſimilar parts of the body; yet ſome are ſo inherent in the body, that they require no cauſe to che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh them, and although they are not fed by the kindling of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours and Spirits, nevertheleſs they will continue, which ſort are called Hecticks. Another hot diſtemper is ſo inherent in the ſimilar parts of the body, that unleſs it be cheriſhed by the kindling of humours and Spirits it can no more ſubſiſt, which Fever is called a Fever in habitude, which in reſpect of the cauſe is twofold, an <hi>Ephemera,</hi> to which alſo a <hi>Synocha</hi> without putrefaction is referred; and a putrid.</p>
                     <p>There is another thing worth the noting, that one Fever is Primary, another Symptomatical, Primary is that which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows no former diſeaſe, but depends on its proper cauſe: Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condary

                     <p>But of Symptomatical this is to be noted, that thoſe which by the ancients were accounted Symptomatical, were indeed primary many of them, and inflamations of the parts, of the Membrane that covers the ribbs, of the lungs or chopps, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther happened to thoſe parts, then the Fever to take it's riſe from them:

                     <p>THere are two ſorts of Fevers whoſe heat are inherent in our bodies in habitude.
<note place="margin">Feavers in habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.</note> For that the hot diſtemper of the parts is cheriſhed either by the heat of the Spirits or humors; and the humors are inflamed either with or without putrefaction.</p>
                     <p>Thoſe Fevers which are ſuſtained by the heat of the Spirits and humours without putrefaction,
<note place="margin">The name Epheme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ros.</note> are called <hi>Ephemerae</hi> and <hi>Humorales</hi> without putrefaction: Thoſe which are kindled by putrifying humours are called putred Fevers.</p>
                     <p>That Fever which is cheriſhed by the kindling of Spirits,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:36866:257"/>is called by the Greeks, <hi>Puretos Ephemeros,</hi> by the Lattines, <hi>Diaria</hi> and <hi>Ephemera,</hi> by a name not taken from the nature of the diſeaſe, but from it's duration. In reſpect of the Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence thereof, it may be defined thus:
<note place="margin">Definition</note> It is a Fever ariſing from and depending on the heating and inflaming of the vital Spirits.</p>
                     <p>The proximate cauſe of this Fever is the heat of the vital Spirits kindled contrary to nature,
<note place="margin">The next cauſe.</note> which being ſpread over the whole body through the arteries, heats the whole againſt nature.</p>
                     <p>That heat is ſtirr'd up from all thoſe cauſes before mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the ſecond Chapter, only except from putrefaction;
<note place="margin">Remote cauſe.</note> which ſometimes immediately, ſometimes remotely, by means of the natural and animal Spirits heat the vital; to wit, perturbations of the mind, ſadneſs, fear, ſollitude, anger, over much watching, too much intentiveneſs of the mind; too much exerciſe of body, grief, hunger, thirſt, hot meats and drinks, drunkenneſs, crudities in bodies cholerick, heat of air, fire, hot Baths, retention of the hot <hi>Effluvium,</hi> infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations of Kernels and Buboes, from the which heat alone without putred vapours is conveyed to the heart according to the vulgar opinion. Yet it ſeemeth not impoſſible but that thoſe putred vapours by the veins and arteries next to the part affected, may be communicated to the heart. And ſo theſe Fevers ſhould rather be Symptomatical then abſolute, putred then <hi>Ephemeral.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thoſe that are hot and dry eaſily fall into this Fever,
<note place="margin">Diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of body.</note> in whom many hot dry vapours are coliected, which are eaſily inflamed by cauſes heating them more.</p>
                     <p>Amongſt the Signs by which this Fever is known and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned from others, in the firſt place, <hi>Galen.</hi> 1 <hi>de differ.
<note place="margin">Diagno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick ſigns.</note> Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brium</hi> c. 7. ſaith, it beginneth from ſome procatartick or evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent cauſe; which indeed is an inſeperable ſign, but not a proper ſign; for although a Fever that doth not ariſe from a manifeſt cauſe is not an <hi>Ephemera,</hi> yet every Fever which ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth from a manifeſt cauſe is not therefore an <hi>Ephemera.</hi> 2. Moreover the Urine in ſubſtance, colour, and contents, is moſt like unto the Urine of healthy men, or at leaſt recedes not much from them, which in an <hi>Ephemera,</hi> which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from crudity, it uſeth to do, in which the Urine uſeth to appear more crude and whiter. 3. The Pulſe is neerer to a natural one, then in any other Fever; only that it uſeth to be extended in magnitude, celerity, and frequency. Yet in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the cauſe which occaſioned the Fever, ſome change
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:36866:258"/>may be made in the Pulſe. 4. The heat of this Fever is gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle and weak in reſpect of other Fevers. 5. Nay in the very ſtate and height thereof it is ſomewhat more gentle and mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate. 6. This Fever invades without ſhakings, or tremb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings; it's increaſe and augmentation in heat and pulſe is free and equal. 7. The declination is performed by moiſture, or moiſt evaporation, by ſweat like theirs who are ſound in health, which by a little exerciſe more then ordinary comes forth, and a perfect apurexſie follows that moiſture, ſo that after the decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation no footing is left for the Fever, either diſcernable by Pulſe or any other circumſtances: And in caſe any footing be left, it is a ſign that it will turn into another ſort of Fever.</p>
                     <p>The cauſes are moſt perfectly to be known by the relation of the ſick, which may inſtruct the Phyſician whether from paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the mind, exerciſe of the body, or any other evident cauſe this diſeaſe hath been occaſioned. Theſe cauſes alſo affords ſome ſigns of themſelves, which the Phyſician cannot be ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of.</p>

<note place="margin">Progno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticks.</note> and continue not above twenty four hours: There is no danger in them, unleſs ſome error be committed, and for the moſt part they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered by nature, wherefore Phyſicians are ſeldom called to their cures. Yet according to the diverſity of their cauſes ſome are cured more eaſily, others with more difficulty. For thoſe cauſes which are hardly taken away, and the humours are ap<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>In the firſt place diligent care is to be had of that Fever E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemeral, which ariſet hfrom the clovure of the skin,

And an <hi>Ephemera</hi> which is cauſed by ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>page of the pores of the skin, ſince it comes to paſs rather from plenty of blood, then ill habit of body, in that a vein is forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to be opened, that the blood may be diminiſhed and cool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; but the thickneſs of the skin if occaſioned by cold or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtringent things is cured by thoſe things that rarifie and open the ſame, by a bath of fair water luke-warm, ſoft rubbings, tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate and luke-warm oils, wherewith the body ſhould be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed. But if the thickneſs of the skin be occaſioned by dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing things, uſe moiſtening dyet, and the body ſhould be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed with temperate and moiſtening oils.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, if the <hi>Ephemera</hi> proceed from crudity,
<note place="margin">From cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity of the ſtomack.</note> ſince that is twofold, the one called Acid, which proceeds from diminution of heat, the other Nitrous, which is cauſed by preter-natural heat: If from Acid crudity, which ſeldom happens, the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemera</hi> proceed, and that crudity be leſs, ſo that meat may be reduced into a better ſtate, reſt and ſleep are to be occaſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and before ſleep meat of eaſie concoction in a ſmall quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity is to be taken, and the ſtomack to be comforted with hot oyls; But if the crudity be great, then the meat is to be ejec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by vomit, or if the ſick be not apt to vomit, with a lenitive, he ſhould provoke a ſtool; before it be diſtributed into the veins he muſt then abſtain from meat, and the ſtomack both with internal and external medicines is to be comforted. But if the crudity be unſavoury or nitrous, 'tis to be conected with cold things, wherewith if the concoction be not helped, the corrupt meat is either to be emitted by vomit, or to be purged by gentle medicines opening the firſt paſſages only, ſuch as are good againſt cholar, and as corroborate the ſtomack.</p>

<note place="margin">An Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mera of many days.</note> called <hi>Ephemera,</hi> to which that appellation doth not belong, becauſe it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended more dayes: Yet it can be referr'd to no other ſort of Fever then this more conveniently; therefore although <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mera</hi> ſhould ſignifie the eſſence of the Fever, <hi>Ephemera</hi> is ſo called though with the addition of more dayes.</p>
                     <p>Such Fevers are thoſe which no wayes differ from <hi>Ephemeral</hi> Fevers newly deſcribed, unleſs in durability, the cauſe of which is obſtruction of cutanious veſſels, which when they do continue ſtopped,

Moreover to theſe belong a <hi>Syno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cha</hi> without putrefaction, commonly called a Fever inflative, which is generated from the fervency of Spirits, and thinner blood without putrefaction.</p>
                     <p>The cauſe of this Fever is the prohibition of the hot Efflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vium,
<note place="margin">Cauſe.</note> ariſing from obſtructions or ſtriction of the pores of the skin in a plethorick body.</p>
                     <p>This continues ſeveral dayes, namely, to the third or fourth day, neither can the plenty of vapours kindled, and exhaleing, which proceed from the blood, be diſcuſſed in one day, nor can the obſtruction or aſtriction of the pores of the skin be ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in one day.</p>

                     <p>This Fever as the other Ephemerals is void of danger,

                     <p>But when this Fever ariſeth by the inflaming of the thinner

                     <p>WHereas there is a two-fold ſort of Fevers, whoſe heat is inherent in the parts according to habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, whereof the one hath it's riſe, and is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued by the kindling of the Spirits, and thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt parts of the blood, without putred humours, the other hath it's original from vapours and putred humours; of the former kind 'tis already ſpoken; The next buſineſs is that we handle the putred Fevers.</p>

<note place="margin">Putred Fevers.</note> For neither is it diſſonant from the nature of humours, but that they may putrifie, ſince that may happen to every mixt body; and we ſee humours putrifie otherwiſe in mans body, as it happens in inflamations, wherein quitture is generated, as <hi>Galen</hi> in the 1 of the differences of Fevers, cap. 6. he compares the putrid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs whereby the humours putrifie in the brain, with that, by which Sanies is generated in the humours.

And the way of cure proves the ſame, for 'tis not performed by things that alter, but evacuate humours, which is partly inſtituted by nature, partly by the Phyſician. For if humoral Fevers could be made without putrefaction, they might alſo be cured by altering things only. And indeed ſuch Fevers are not only malignant as ſome think, but the ſame ſigns appear, and the ſame way of cure is exhibited to intermittent and continued,
<note place="margin">What Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trefaction is.</note> which are void of all malignity and peſtilency.</p>

It is (ſays he) a change of the whole ſubſtance of the body putrifying to corruption, by reaſon of extrane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous heat; the ultimate end of putrefaction is the diſſolution of the parts whereof the mixt body conſiſts, and the corruption of the whole mixture.</p>
                     <p>That we may here paſs by the tedious diſputations which are extant amongſt Philoſophers and Phyſicians concerning putre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, this is to be taken notice of,

                        </note> whereby mixt bodies are plainly diſſolved in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Elements, out of which they are bred: The other is in ſome part, and imperfect, whereby theſe which are full of moiſture,
<note place="margin">in ſome part.</note> putrify. For ſeeing the moiſture wherewith it aboundeth can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not wholly be drawn out, only ſome parts thereof, eſpecially the thinner are. And ſuch putrefaction, namely, according to parts, agrees to humors alſo; namely, when ſome particles of theirs are really corrupted, and they looſe their form: Yet the whole hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour muſt not neceſſarily looſe it's form; thence it continues it's name, and thoſe corrupted parts being evacuated, it returns to its former nature; unleſs the corruption have ſo far gone, that mutation is made into another kind. Which putrefaction, is pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trefaction indeed, and not alteration only. For although the whole be not corrupted, yet ſome parts thereof are really cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted.</p>
                     <p>Putrefaction in a body is cauſed by extraneous heat,
<note place="margin">The cauſe of putrefac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> and when the humours are no longer governed by the natural heat, but are deſtitute thereof, they are corrupted. Therefore all things whatſoever which may be an occaſion to hinder the innate heat, ſo that it cannot in its due manner govern the humours, may be ſaid to be the cauſe of putrefaction of the humours.</p>
                     <p>Putrefaction of humours though oftentimes it be cauſed by obſtruction, and bowels, and prohibiting of free tranſpiration, ſince that, as <hi>Galen.</hi> 11. Meth. med. c. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Firſt, certain humours by reaſon of ſome internal defect,
<note place="margin">Default of humours.</note> of heir own accord tend to putrefaction, or at leaſt are caſily over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:36866:261"/>come by ſmall cauſes of putrefaction, and having gotten the leaſt occaſion fall into putrefaction: Such vice humours contract firſt from bad meats, of the which they are generated, whether they are ſuch by nature, or any other wayes corrupted: More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over by meats which are eaſily corrupted, ſuch are fruits rare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ripe. Thirdly, from the ill dreſſing of meats, or ill concoction, or when they are taken in exceſs, or at unſeaſonable hours, or after a prepoſterous manner. Fourthly, by the default of the parts appointed for concoction, by reaſon whereof even the beſt aliment may be corrupted. Laſtly by reaſon of other cauſes which either impede concoction, or retain execrements, as alſo the prepoſterous uſe of the ſix Non-naturals. Therefore by how much the more of ſuch humours are cumulated in the body, by ſo much the more eaſily they putrify. For nature doth not defend excrementitious humours ſo carefully as thoſe which are fit to nouriſh the body; whence they are eaſily corrupted and putrify. Blood alſo out of the veins, being out of it's natural place, and of a hot and moiſt nature eaſily is corrupted. But al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though ſuch humours turn to putrefaction of their own accord, and being in a hot and moiſt place; yet it happens ſooner if any other cauſe be added. Nay good humours alſo in a ſound body if they are the cauſe in p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Amongſt all theſe cauſes the firſt and chiefeſt is the hinderance of tranſpiration and ventilation,

For hot and moiſt things in a hot place unleſs they are ventilated, eaſily putrify. Narrowneſs of pores is occaſioned either by conſtriction from cold, or aſtrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent things, or drineſs, as ſtaying under the Sun-beams; or by Obſtructions, which either plenty or vicoſity, or thickneſs of humours brings forth. Moreover the internal paſſages are ſtopped, either through ſtore of blood over-flowing in the body, or plenty of it contracted up and down in many parts, or by the thickneſs and viſcouſneſs of humours.</p>

And the humours ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſimply putrify, or a malignant venemous quality and conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion is joyned with it. Furthermore the place wherein the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours putrefie is not alwayes the ſame; For ſometimes the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours putrefie within the veins and arteries, ſometimes without them. And that putrefaction which is within the veſſels, is either equally in all the veſſels, or in the greateſt, or in certain parts of a vein.</p>
                     <p>Whence theſe differences of Fevers do ariſe. Firſt, ſome Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers are ſimply putred, without any malignity or contagion, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers malignant, poſtilent, contagious. Moreover ſome Fevers are continual, others intermittent, according as the putred va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pour which is the cauſe containing of putred Fevers, or heat ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red up by putred humours either continually heats the heart, and from thence is diffuſed over all the body, or by certain inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valls.</p>
                     <p>Of either of which kinds of Fevers there are again many diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences; For either the putrefaction is kindled in the common veſſels, and not in private paſſages, whence ariſe continued Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, called Primary: Or the putredity comes by the inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of ſome peculiar part, and from thence putred vapours are continually communicated to the heart, which Fevers are called Symptomatical.</p>

Becauſe it begins without any manifeſt cauſe. Which indeed is a proper ſign, but not an inſeparable one, for as often as any Fever is kindled without any manifeſt cauſe, you may well determine it to be a putred Fever: Yet ſometimes humours are ſo diſpoſed to putrefaction, that upon any light occaſion they'l become putred. 3.

Nor indeed ought vital indications to be neglected. Firſt, a Fever as it is a Fever, indicates cooling things; Moreover as that heat of the whole depends on a hot putred vapour, as on the cauſe containing, the removal of that is alſo indicated; but becauſe putred vapours depend on putred matter, they cannot be removed, unleſs the matter putrified be taken away; putrefaction cannot be taken away except its cauſe be removed, as we ſaid before. Firſt, all evident cauſes which are preſent are to be removed; the antecedent cauſes and whatſoever is in the body, either of ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous blood or peccant humours, they are to be prepared. and if occaſion require, to be evacuated, ſtreightneſs of paſſages if it be external or interal in the bowels, they are to be opened and free ventilation and reſpiration for the humours is to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured, Putrefaction is to be reſiſted, and the putred humours are to be cooled and dryed; the generation of peccant humours, by ablation of their cauſe is to be prevented.

<note place="margin">Letting blood.</note> and firſt concerning Phlebotomy. <hi>Galen</hi> 11. <hi>meth. medendi. cap.</hi> 15. gives this rule. It is moſt wholeſome he ſayes in all Fevers to open a vein, not only in continued, but alſo in all others which the putrifying humour ſtirreth up,
<note place="margin">Whether, when, and why to be done in a putred Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.</note> eſpecially when neither age nor want of ſtrength prohibites it. And he addeth this reaſon; For nature which rules our bodies being enlighthed, and unburthened of that by which as with a pack it was oppreſſed, what remains, it will overcome without difficulty, and therefore not being forgetful of its proper office, will both concoct what can be concocted, and caſt out what may be emitted. Yet this precept of <hi>Galen</hi> is to be rightly underſtood and explained. For although there are many occaſions for opening a vein, and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors cannot agree about the reaſon why <hi>Galen</hi> commands Phle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>botomy in putred Fevers: Yet 'tis clear he did it, that by evacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of the blood, nature might be enlightened and freed from the greateſt part of her burthen, for when blood abounds, the opening of a vein, and purging of Cacochymy are the beſt reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies; furthermore when it is a plethorick body, without doubt we ſhould open a vein. In ſome meaſure the breathing of a vein, doth take away the cacochymy contained in the veins, and mixed with the blood, ſince the vein being opened, the vitious humours go out with the blood, eſpecially becauſe purgation which can take away foul humours out of the veins, is not ſo ſafe as the breathing of a vein to be appointed at the beginning of a Fever. For although Phlebotomy cannot take away all the ill humours out of the veins, yet nature is leſſned ſome part of her burthen, and therefore can concoct and maſter the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the more eaſily, for it may be that the plenty of blood, which before the ſickneſs was no trouble to the party, now being ſick and weakened with a Fever, may become burthenſom unto him. And although ſome good blood be emitted therewith, yet that hurts not the ſick, but rather helps, as is ſaid: As we alſo ſee by critical Hemorrhodes, that nature ſends out no ſmall quantity of good blood together. Yet nature for the moſt part uſeth to

                     <p>Concerning Purgers at what time they are to be uſed, there is great controverſie; for although vitious humours at any time during the deſeaſe, ſhew that they ought to be taken away; Yet they ought not to be evacuated at any time, but inſtead of an Oracle, <hi>Galen</hi> admoniſheth four of preſervation of health, <hi>c.</hi> 5. the Aphoriſme of <hi>Hippocrates</hi> is to be had in eſteem, 22. <hi>Sect.</hi> 1. Such as are concocted and ripe, ought to be purged and removed, not crude; neither in the beginnings, unleſs the matter trouble much, which ſeldom cometh to paſs. But although ſome inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret this Aphoriſm otherwiſe, yet if it be diligently conſidered, 'twill be manifeſt, that <hi>Hippocrates</hi> meant to ſpeak only of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred Fevers, and of no other diſeaſe, and by crude humours in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends thoſe that by reaſon of their putreſection in putred Fevers
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:36866:264"/>ought not to be purged, being unfit; by concocted he intends ſuch as are fitting to be purged: The words crudity and concoction, being tranſſated from their proper ſignification of crudity and concoction to excrementitious humours.</p>
                     <p>Although there are certain other preparations of humours for purgation both in Fevers and out of Fevers:
<note place="margin">Concoction of humors.</note> Yet the name of concoction belongs not to them, and we muſt diſtinguiſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt concoction and preparation of humours. Concoction, whereof <hi>Hippocrates</hi> ſpeaketh, is a reducing of the putred hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours into a better condition, and leſs obnoxious to the body, and a ſeparation of them from good blood, that they may the more profitably be evacuated out of the body; hence concoction belongs only to humours, which are contained in the Veins, and mixed with the blood, but thoſe that are in other places, and not mixed with the blood, may be purged at any time. For theſe humours unleſs they are reduced to a certain mediocrity as they are capable of, and are ſeperated from laudable blood, the Phyſician in vain, and with much detriment to the ſick, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to expell them by purging. For neither will the humours follow the foregoing medicine, neither hath the Phyſician na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture for his aſſiſtant, ſince the matter is only ſtirr'd and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, and various Symptomes ariſe; either the ſtrength is weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the vio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Yet flatulent humours may be purged without concoction;
<note place="margin">Flatulent humours.</note> For although theſe are not as yet concocted, yet becauſe there is not only danger leſt they ſhould fall upon ſome principal part, but alſo becauſe being thin, and already in motion, they eaſily follow their leading medicine; and the Phyſician hath nature to aſſiſt him, which alone ſometimes expells ſuch humours at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, to the great advantage of the ſick. But by flatulent hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours here, we are not to underſtand only thoſe which hitherto are moved to no determinate part, but alſo thoſe which although they ruſh into ſome part yet they are ſtill moveable, and ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, that they'l eaſily remove into another part, and according to their manner, are hitherto wandring, but have not any fixed ſeat any where.</p>
                     <p>Concoction, whereof we here ſpeak, is the work of nature on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, which when 'tis ſtrong, gives what perfection they are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of receiving, even to the vitious humours, as may be ſeen in the generation of quitture; and this concoction is made only in putred Fevers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For whileſt the humours ferment in the veins, like new wine, and the good and bad are mixt together,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:36866:265"/>and cannot eaſily be ſeperated: They are called crude, but when the humours are appeaſed and cooled, and the good may eaſily be ſeperated from the evil, they are ſaid to be concocted.</p>

<note place="margin">Form of Diet.</note> quantity, quality, and time. The form of dyet is three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold, thick, indifferent, and thin. Which of theſe are moſt proper for every one, is to be collected by comparing the ſtrength of the ſick with the morbifique cauſe; neither ought we to give more meat then the ſtrength can concoct: and we ought to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider whether the ſtrength do more require food, or the diſeaſe forbid it, or the contrary: for by how much the buſier nature is in oppugning the morbifique cauſe, by ſo much the leſs thre ought to be burthened with food: She is by ſo much the more buſied in oppoſing the diſeaſe, by how much the paroxiſm is neerer at hand, hence <hi>Hippocrates</hi> 1. <hi>Aphor.</hi> 8. When the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe is in it's vigour, then 'tis neceſſary to uſe the thinneſt
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:36866:266"/>food, and 1. <hi>Aph.</hi> 7. When the diſeaſe is peracute, there are extream labourings; and at height, the thinneſt nutriment is to be taken. But when 'tis not at height, and that we may uſe more nouriſhing things, by ſo much is to varied from the thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt of all, by how much the diſeaſe is remitted and abated, and ibid. 10. Thoſe who expect the vigour forthwith to come, ought preſently to take a little nouriſhment. They who expect it af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards much, and ſhould both in the vigour of it, and a little before it, abſtain. But before-hand the ſick ſhould be more plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully nouriſhed, that he might be the better able to endure the diſeaſe. But how dyet is to be moderated according to the ſtrength, <hi>Hippocrates</hi> teacheth, 1 <hi>Aphor.</hi> 9. We ought to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture by the ſick, whether he can hold out to the vigour of the diſeaſe by the preſcribed dyet or not, or whether he will firſt faint, and being inſufficient with ſuch food, ſhould dye before the diſeaſe depart and be overcome. And 1. <hi>Aphor.</hi> 13. Old men that are not decrepid eaſily endure to faſt, according to theſe, middle aged men, young men leſs, children leaſt of all; and amongſt them eſpecially ſuch as are endued with the choiceſt and moſt acute wits: Cuſtom alſo and courſe of life is to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered in preſcribing of dyet.</p>
                     <p>The quantity of meat alſo is to be conſidered by comparing of the diſeaſe with the ſtrength of the ſick:
<note place="margin">Quantity.</note> For ſince that we muſt never give more food then can be concocted at the time when nature is moſt buſied in oppoſing the morbifique cauſe, the leaſt quantity of food is to be taken, which is in the height thereof.</p>
                     <p>Concerning the quality of meat,
<note place="margin">Quality.</note> ſince it is to be conſidered either as it is meat, or as it is medicinal meat, in the former reſpect thoſe meats are to be choſen that are of eaſieſt concoction, full of good juyce, facile to be diſtributed, and which hath the leaſt excrements: But if it be conſidered as Medicinal, Firſt, it ought to be contrary to the Fever, and therefore it ſhould be cold and moiſt, 1. <hi>Aphor.</hi> 16. moreover it ſhould be repugnant to the cauſes, and all exceſs of qualities in them.</p>
                     <p>The time for food is moſt proper when 'tis indicated,
<note place="margin">Time.</note> when the body requires nouriſhment, which is when the former meat is concocted, and no ſign is preſent, which may prohibit the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of it, to wit, no combate betwixt nature and the diſeaſe; therefore during the fits, we ought to abſtain. 1. <hi>Aphor.</hi> 11. un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs the ſtrength be much decayed and ſpent.</p>
                     <p>Care alſo is to be taken what drink is fitteſt in Fevers, for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it be eaſier concocted then meat,
<note place="margin">Drink.</note> and by it's cooling it
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:36866:267"/>mitigates the heat, and the drineſs is hindred: Yet we are to be careful that nature be not burthened with it, and the concoction of matter hindred by it, and therefore in intermitting Fevers during the Paroxiſm, we ſhould abſtain from drink as neer as we can: But in continued Fevers, when heat, thirſt, and debility of ſtrength do require, you may give more drink; but ſithence drink is to be conſidered, not as drink only, but as medicinal, hence it comes to paſs, that at certain times, certain drinks are to be choſen. Drink conſidered as drink, ought to be given ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the rules for meat: But as it is conſidered as altering, by how much the dry heat is more intenſe, by ſo much the more, hotter drinks are to be avoided, and the colder to be cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen. Yet regard is to be taken of the cauſe, and oftentimes there will be need of attenuating and abſterging drinks, and not of cooling only; and the matter being deeper faſtened in the part, admits not cooling drink. The drinking of cold water is only uſeful in acute Fevers, 'tis never proper in intermittent. Fair water is often altered with barley, which is called a decoction, and barley-water. Inſtead of drink, Juleps are alſo exhibited, water mixed with Honey, Oxymel, Emulſions, Whey, ſtrong beer, wine. But ſeeing certain drinks for certain Fevers are moſt convenient, we may more properly handle them ſeverally amongſt the different kinds of Fevers, of which ſorts are peculiar for ſuch a particular Fever then in general to treat thereof.</p>
                     <p>The air in all Fevers ought to be pure, cold rather then hot, yet ſo temper'd,
<note place="margin">Air.</note> that the drawing in thereof may rather allay the fevouriſh heat, then meeting with a naked body, cauſe it to ſhut its own pores, which hinders the diſcuſſion of vapours and ſweats, and therefore the ſick is to be covered with outward gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, but ſuch as are light, that ſo the heat may be drawn to the outmoſt parts of the body.</p>
                     <p>Sleep ought to be moderate. Reſt in putred Fevers is moſt advantagious:
<note place="margin">Sleep, rest. Excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of the mind.</note> Excrements ought not to be retained beyond meaſure, but to be ejected in due time.

                     <p>HItherto we have ſpoken of putred Fevers in general,
<note place="margin">The diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences of putred Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers.</note> it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains that now we ſpeak of them particularly. Firſt their differences are a little more cleerly to be explained. And they are taken chiefly from the matter putrifying, and the place of putrefaction.</p>
                     <p>As for the matter, Feversariſe either from choller, or phlegm,
<note place="margin">From the matter.</note> blood or melancholly: To which not without reaſon is added a ſerous humour, eſpecially that Ichor, which is very evil, eaſily obnoxious to putrefaction,
<note place="margin">A ſerous humour.</note> and cauſeth the blood and other hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours to putrefie more eaſily. Whence ſome are of opinion that Ephemeral Fevers, which commonly are ſaid to ariſe from Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits kindled, do all proceed from the ebullition of the ſerous part of the venous or arterious blood: And much more a <hi>Synocha</hi> without putrefaction; although the vital Spirits being heat may firſt allure the heat to the ſerous humour. The ſame ſhew that all <hi>Synochaes</hi> or Fevers containing, as they are called, which have no periods, as well putred as not putred, do ariſe from the ſame aqueous and ſerous humour, whether putrefying or not putre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying; whereof the Tract of Fevers may be ſeen.</p>
                     <p>Thoſe Fevers which proceed from blood do all keep a certain continuity and equality; and are neither exaſperated daily,
<note place="margin">From blood. Phlegm. Choller.</note> nor each other day, nor the fourth day, but thoſe which do ariſe from Phlegmatick, chollerick, or melancholy humours, all have their periods, whether they are continued or intermittent.</p>
                     <p>Beſides theſe there are other Fevers,
<note place="margin">Melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</note> which although they are exaſperated, yet have no certain periods, ſuch are thoſe which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe from inflammation, putrefaction, worms, corrupted milk;
<note place="margin">From other cauſes.</note> as in Infants, blood out of the Veſſels, chyle, and blood im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect, putrefying in the Meſaraicks.</p>
                     <p>The matter whereof putred vapours are bred in Fevers,
<note place="margin">From the place.</note> is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther contained within the veſſels or without. The veſſels which carry the perfect blood, as the vena cava, and the arteries, or the more imperfect, as the Meſeraick veins.
<note place="margin">within the veſſels.</note> Whileſt blood pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trifies in the vena cava, there ariſe continued Fevers, whereof ſome are called <hi>Synochaes,</hi> or containing Fevers, others conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued inſtead of a genus and periodick continued. If excremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titious humours putrefie in the Meſaraicks, intermittent Fevers are ſtirred up, but if imperfect blood putrifie in the Meſaraick
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:36866:268"/>veins, continued Fevers are raiſed, but calm ones.</p>
                     <p>Putrifying matter without the veſlels,
<note place="margin">Without the veſſels.</note> ſending putred va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours to the veins and arteries, kindles continued Fevers. Such are firſt Symptomatical, which proceed from inflammations of certain parts. Moreover calmer Fevers, which proceed from the ſtubborneſs of the guts and their obſtructions. Thirdly, thoſe that are cauſed by an Ulcer, Fiſtula, and all putrefaction. Fourthly, from corrupt milk, as in Infants, from blood putre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying without the veſſels, alſo the matter of Catarrhs, whence they are called Catarrhal Fevers.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, there are Fevers called <hi>Comitatae,</hi> or Companions, which are occaſioned from matter putrefying in the veins,
<note place="margin">Fevers ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied.</note> part whereof when nature either expells out of the body, which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens in a Diarrhaea, Dyſentery, and a Catarrh, or protrudeth into ſome part, which happens in the Meazles, Small Pox, Stragling pains, Quinſey, Peripneumonie, Phrenſie, Eriſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelas, oftentimes.

                     <head>CHAP. XI. <hi>Of a continued putred primary Fever, and firſt of a</hi> Synocha <hi>in particular.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>NOw concerning putred Fevers in particular,
<note place="margin">A primary continued Fever.</note> and firſt we will handle a primary continued Fever: A primary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued Fever is that which comes not to apurexie before it be plainly taken away; and hath its riſe from putred humours contained in the greater branches of the vena cava and arterie. For ſince that thence putred vapours are continually ſent to the heart, a continued heat is alſo cauſed, thence until it fully be cured there is no abſence of fire, neither doth it return by intervalls, with tremblings and ſhaking fits.</p>
                     <p>Primary continued Fevers are two-fold, Some without any remiſſion or exacerbation of the heat, continue from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to the end: But there are others, wherein the heat before the Fever be throughly cured, doth never totally depart, yet at certain periods is increaſed. The former are called fiery <hi>Syno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaes,</hi> and Fevers containing; the other are called <hi>Synoches,</hi> or continued, inſtead of a genus.</p>
                     <p>The Fever <hi>Synocha</hi> putred,
<note place="margin">A Puered Synocha.</note> is a Fever, which without any ſlacking or increaſing afflicteth from the beginning to the end, ariſing from putrefaction of the blood in the greater branches of
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:36866:268"/>the vena cava. Although continued Fevers may ariſe out of veſſels of determinate parts, yet ſuch are Symptomatical: And if they are true Synochaes, which have their original from the default of any part, as from the womb offending: Yet that part only affords an occaſion, the polluted, putredity being commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated, that the blood in the greater veſſels might corrupt. But there are Fevers riſen from determinate parts, for the moſt part continued Periodicks.</p>
                     <p>So ſometimes peccant matter in the firſt paſſages collected in the firſt concoction, which uſeth to go to ſome of the humours, which at certain Periods are moved, and hath not as yet received its limits for motion, it uſeth then to corrupt the humours, and communicate putrefaction to the vena cava, which Fevers for the moſt part are malignant.</p>
                     <p>A putred <hi>Synocha</hi> hath its original for the moſt part from tranſpiration hindred, and want of ventilation of the blood,
<note place="margin">The cauſe.</note> and hot fuliginous retentions, by reaſon of obſtruction of veins, as well in the skin, as alſo in the internal parts. And the blood ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to nouriſh the body putrifies in theſe <hi>Synochaes,</hi> and putrefying, continually ſends hot vapours to the heart. For when preter-natural heat is ſo kindled in the veins, that nature can no longer rule it, it becomes putred and is corrupted. Nor is there any need that the putred blood ſhould be turned into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther humour preſently. For blood of its own nature is apt to putrefaction, and in inflamations we ſee it changed to quitture, not into choller; though nothing hinder it in the veins but that it might: And eſpecially the Ichor or thin wate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh part of the blood is apt to turn to putrefaction, and by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the Ichor the blood in the firſt place is corrupted, which happens, when the vapours which ought to tranſpire, are retai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the veins. Yet the whole blood doth not putrifie, but ſome parts thereof, which ſo long as they are not ſeperated from the good blood, crudity is ſaid to be preſent, which afterwards by concoction are ſeperated from the good blood, which being done, Nature appoints evacuation, by which the blood returns to its former purity again.</p>
                     <p>A <hi>Synocha</hi> is three-fold, <hi>Acmastick,</hi> i. e. when it remains al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes in the ſame ſtate, namely,
<note place="margin">Differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</note> when ſo much of the humour daily putrifies as is diſcuſſed, this is called alſo <hi>Homotonos. Epacmastick</hi> or <hi>Anabaticos</hi> is when the heat continually increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, and more of the matter is kindled then can be diſcuſſed. <hi>Paraemaſtick</hi> is when there is more diſcuſſed then corrupted, and thence the heat alwayes decresſeth. Furthermore it blood which
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:36866:269"/>putrifies be temperate abſolute, 'tis called a ſanguinious <hi>Synoch a</hi> in particular: But if it be hotter, which uſeth to be called cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerick, the diſeaſe is then called <hi>Synocha biloſa.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Fever is known firſt by this,
<note place="margin">Diagno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick ſigns.</note> that it continues from the beginning to the end without any exaſperation and mutation: Moreover becauſe the Pulſe is great, vehement, ſwift, frequent, unequal and inordinate. And in a <hi>Synocha</hi> proceeding from temperate blood the ſigns of Plethory are preſent: The blood to him that toucheth ſeems much and full of vapours, and is not ſo troubleſome and ſharp as in other Fevers, and other ſignes are preſent which are obſerved in a <hi>Synocha</hi> that is not putred. A putred <hi>Synocha</hi> is diſtinguiſhed from a non-putred by certain ſigns. The heat in a putred is ſharper then in a non-putred. In a putred the urine is red, thick and troubled, without any ſedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and crude, or a little concocted in the beginning; the Pulſe affords ſignes of putrefaction, and all the Symptomes are greater then in a Fever that is not putred.</p>
                     <p>A <hi>Synochabiloſa</hi> happens to thoſe that are troubled with cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerick blood, and the heat is ſharper then in a <hi>Synocha</hi> proceeding from temperate blood, thirſt is more troubleſome, the urine thinner and ſharper, and other ſignes which are uſual in cholerick Fevers are diſcerned.</p>
                     <p>This Fever is the moſt ſimple amongſt the putred,
<note place="margin">Progno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticks.</note> and eaſieſt to be cured. And being pure, ſeldom paſſeth ſeven dayes, but the ſpurious is extended to the fourteenth day, and is terminated ſooner or later, as the ſignes of concoction appear ſooner or later. A white urine in a <hi>Synocha</hi> is evil. The leaſt dangerous of all is that which is called <hi>Synochos Paracmaſticos,</hi> next to that <hi>Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſticos:</hi> But that is moſt dangerous which continually increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, and is called <hi>Epacmaſticos,</hi> which eaſily degenerates into a diſeaſe called <hi>Cauſus.</hi> And by how much the fewer the evil Symptomes are, by ſo much the better hopes; the more they are, the more danger is ſhewn.</p>
                     <p>The whole cure conſiſts in taking away the cauſe,
<note place="margin">Indicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.</note> and alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the fevouriſh heat. Blood therefore as abounding in plenty is to be leſſened, the pores of the skin to be opened, the cauſes of obſtructions being taken away. The fevouriſh heat is to be tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered and allayed, if there be ſtrength, as for the moſt part there is, thin diet is to be uſed.</p>
                     <p>Therefore a vein is forthwith to be opened in the right arm, a Clyſter or lenitive medicine being given firſt, if occaſion require, and to take away as much blood as the ſtrength will permit.
<note place="margin">Breathing of a vein.</note> and you may more boldly take away blood in this, then in any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſort of Fever.</p>
                     <pb n="31" facs="tcp:36866:269"/>
                     <p>Blood being evacuated,
<note place="margin">Medicines.</note> that the concoction may be made more facile, we are to uſe thoſe things which allay the heat, free from obſtructions, and reſiſt putrefaction; namely, the juice of Sorrel, Lemmons, Citrons, and Syrrups and Conſerves prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of them, Syrrup of Sorrel ſimple, Oxymel ſimple, Oxyſau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>harum ſimple, Spirit of Vitriol, and the four cold ſeeds with cooling waters are to be adminiſtred.</p>
                     <p>Principally we ought to endeavour that the pores of the skin may be freed from obſtruction, which for the moſt part is the cauſe of this diſeaſe, which thing Oxymel and wine mingled with honey, and the honey diſſolved, will conveniently perform, ſince they are eaſily carried to the outmoſt parts of the body, and attenuate dull thick humours, and ſimple Oxymel reſiſts putre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction.</p>
                     <p>Concoction being perfected, the Ancients uſed to drink cold water, and gave ſo much of it to drink, as might not only extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh the fevouriſh hear, but that the matter concocted might be evacuated by ſtool, vomit or ſweats. But in our countries, ſick people are not ſo accuſtomed to drink cold water, and many inconveniences are to be feared by the uſe thereof. So likewiſe ſwimming in cold water, which was uſual with the Ancients, doth not agree with our bodies.</p>
                     <p>The concoction being perfected, nature uſeth for the moſt part critically to evacuate the corrupted matter, which if it be not done, it ought to be performed by the Phyſician with purging medicines.</p>
                     <p>Dyet in this Fever ought to be thin,
<note place="margin">Diet.</note> becauſe both that blood aboundeth, and the diſeaſe is ſhort; It ſhould be cooling and moiſtening, and alſo to have power of attenuating thick hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, and deterging viſcid ones.</p>

                     </head>
                     <p>WHereas amongſt continued Fevers there is often men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion made of a <hi>Cauſus,</hi> we are alſo here to ſay ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of it: But a <hi>Cauſus</hi> is not any difference of a Fever, but rather a meaſure expreſſing the quality of fevouriſh heat. The word <hi>Cauſus</hi> is ſometimes taken generally, and not ſo properly, ſometimes <hi>ſpecialiter,</hi> and more properly: Generally for any ſort of Fever whoſe heat is vehement, in particular for a Fever which hath two Pathognomonicks, great heat, extream and
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:36866:270"/>unextinguiſhable thirſt. A <hi>Cauſus</hi> properly and in ſpecie ſo called, is again twofold, legitimate and ſpurious: legitimate is that which hath alwayes, and that evidently, thoſe two ſignes joyned with it: an illegitimate is that wherein thoſe two ſignes are not ſo evident.</p>
                     <p>Whence it is manifeſt that burning Fevers,
<note place="margin">Burning Fevers.</note> and ſuch as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly and in ſpecie are ſo called, are continued Fevers, and ariſe from choller. And ſo a <hi>Cauſus</hi> or burning Fever properly ſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, is a Fever continued, Bilions, and indeed either <hi>Synocha biloſa,</hi> which we have newly handled, or a continued tertian, whereof we are to ſpeak next.</p>
                     <p>The Pathognomonick ſignes as we ſaid before, are two, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement and burning heat, and unquenchable thirſt, although the ſick ſhall drink;
<note place="margin">Diagno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticks.</note> and the more legitimate the <hi>Cauſus</hi> is, by ſo much theſe ſignes are greater, yet the thirſt is ſometimes reſiſted if a little cough happen, which may draw humors from the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring parts.</p>
                     <p>Concurrent ſignes there are many, as a dry tongue, rough, black, watching, giddineſs of the brain, difficulty of breathing, thick and great, and the ſick continually blow, opening their mouth, that the hot ſpirits may the eaſier exhale.</p>
                     <p>Theſe Fevers if they are pure,
<note place="margin">Progno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticks.</note> never continue long. For na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture cannot long endure ſuch burning and vehement heat; and the Symptomes which accompany it with their vehemency. And for the moſt part they are terminated the ſeventh day, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the ninth, eleventh, fourteenth: but the ſpurious are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted longer, and all of them are dangerous according to <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrates</hi> 4. <hi>Aphor.</hi> 43. Fevers of what kind ſoever that have no intermiſſion by the third day, are the ſtronger, and fuller of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. Yet ſome are more dangerous then others, according to the violence of the heat, and of the Symptomes, and force of the ſtrength, and by how much the greater digreſſion is made from the natural ſtate, by ſo much the more dangerous is the Fever. Hence if an old man be troubled with a burning Fever, which ſeldom happens, 'tis deadly, as <hi>Galen</hi> hath it, 1. <hi>Aphor.</hi> 14. They lye down in no leſs danger who are exeedingly burnt in cold air: Who if they have not great ſtrength, neither the ſignes of concoction appear, it can not be that they ſhould eſcape, as the ſame <hi>Galen</hi> 11. <hi>Met. med. cap.</hi> 9. writeth. To whom if vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Symptomes happen, by ſo much the more dangerous the diſeaſe ſhall be, whether they are Pathognomonick or ſuperveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, yet if by the other ſignes, it be manifeſt to be a burning Fever, and that thirſt be wanting, this alſo is dangerous, for
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:36866:270"/>it ſhews the ſick either to be in a Delirium, or that the deſiring faculty of the ſtomack faileth.</p>
                     <p>Black urines are alſo evil, as alſo thin, crude, and ſuch as have other ill tokens in them.</p>
                     <p>But it is good if the ſick can eaſily endure his ſickneſs, the Symptomes being not without vehemency, if he can eaſily fetch breath; if he complain of pain in no internal part, if he ſleep; if he find benefit by his ſleep; if the body be equally hot and ſoft, if the tongue be not too dry, if the urine be good. But if when the ſignes of concoction appear, and that there is much ſtrength, in a critical day there happen large Hemorrhodes, or bleeding at the noſe, without doubt the ſick eſcapeth: For it is proper if there be any other of the pure burning Fevers, that they ſhould be cured by bleeding. Yet ſometimes they are determined by Sweats, looſeneſs of the belly, vomits, and impoſthums. But there are many Prognoſticks of burning Fevers in <hi>Hippocrates</hi> in <hi>Prognosticis, Porrheticus,</hi> and <hi>Choacis praenotionibus,</hi> and there are many expounded in the Inſtitutions, lib. 3. part. 3.</p>
                     <p>But by what means burning Fevers are to be cured, appears by what hath been ſpoken of a <hi>Synocha biloſa</hi> with putrefaction, and thoſe things that ſhall be ſaid of the cure of the continued Tertian ſhall make manifeſt.</p>

                     </head>
                     <p>ANother kind of continued putred Fevers which they call in particular continued, comprehends thoſe Fevers,
<note place="margin">Continus periodick Fevers.</note> which indeed continually remain, and have no remiſſion before they are plainly diſſolved, yet at certain periods they are exaſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, whence they are called continued periodick and proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated Fevers.</p>
                     <p>But as Fevers containing have their original from the blood appointed for nouriſhing the body; ſo continued Periodicks,
<note place="margin">their cauſes.</note> as alſo intermittints proceed from an excrementitious humour and Cacochymie. Therefore continued Periodicks agree in this with Fevers containing, that both their cauſes are contained in the vena cava, but with intermittents in this that both proceed from excrementitious humours. But they differ from Fevers contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, in that they proceed from alimentary blood; theſe from an excrementitious humour: From intermittent becauſe the
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:36866:271"/>matter which is the cauſe of continued Periodicks is generated in the ſecond concoction, and contained in the vena cava: But that matter which is the cauſe of intermitting Fevers is contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the firſt concoction, or certainly in thoſe parts which are about the liver, which are not appointed for perfect ſanguifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. Namely, the matter of continued Periodick Fevers is generated in the Organs of the ſecond concoction, if for any cauſe whatſoever it be not rightly performed. For then the pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant humours generated in the ſecond concoction are ſent with the blood into the veins, which there ſtirreth up theſe continued periodick Fevers.</p>
                     <p>Which matter ſince it is not only confuſed with the blood, as in intermitting Fevers,
<note place="margin">The reaſon of its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuity.</note> but from the very firſt original is mixed therewith throughly. Nature alſo cannot expell it before con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction, and therefore the Fever from the beginning continually laſteth. Yet theſe Fevers have exaſperations at ſet times, becauſe that from the inſtruments of the ſecond concoction, freſh mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which is the cauſe of theſe periods is afforded, and indeed for the moſt part from the liver: Whence alſo continued Terti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans are moſt frequent.</p>
                     <p>Theſe Fevers are generally known becauſe they never come to apurexie,
<note place="margin">Signs.</note> yet at certain periods they are increaſed and remitted. Neither doth cold, trembling, nor ſhaking fits precede their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſperation, neither doth ſweat follow their remiſſion.</p>
                     <p>There are three kinds of theſe Fevers.</p>
                     <p>For ſome are exaſperated each other day,
<note place="margin">Differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</note> and proceed from Choller, and are called Tertians continued. Others every day which are cauſed by Phlegm, and are called continued quotidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans. Others the fourth day, which ariſe from Melancholy, and are called Quartans continued.</p>
                     <p>Firſt a tertian continued is a putred Fever,
<note place="margin">A Tertian continued.</note> ariſing from blood with ill juyce and choller putrefying in the vena cava, indeed continued, but afflicting moſt the third day.</p>
                     <p>The cauſes of this Fever are all things which can increaſe ſtore of cholerick Cacochymy in the veins,
<note place="margin">The cauſe.</note> and being cumulated there of cholerick Cacochymy in the veins, and being cumulated there can introduce putrefaction; ſuch as are before propounded.</p>
                     <p>This Fever is thus known,
<note place="margin">Signs.</note> in that it is continued, and the third day it is exaſperated. Yet there are preſent other ſignes and Symptomes of continued and burning Fevers.</p>
                     <p>But what is to be hoped concerning their event,
<note place="margin">Progno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticks.</note> is manifeſt from things which are ſpoken of the Prognoſticks of burning Fevers.</p>
                     <p>Concerning the indications for cure,
<note place="margin">Cure.</note> this Fever if it be pure,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:36866:271"/>ſince it is exceeding hot and burning, and the cauſe thereof hot and dry, it requires extraordinary cooling and moiſtening, and indeed more then any other Fever.</p>
                     <p>The humour it ſelf indicates evacuation; but crudity for the moſt part forbids it: but if the Fever be ſpurious, regard is to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether to be had to the humour which is mixed with choller: if the Symptomes need it they are to be reſiſted likewiſe.</p>

                     <pb n="37" facs="tcp:36866:272"/>
                     <p>The cauſe of this Fever is Phlegm mixed with blood in the vena cava, and there putrifying,
<note place="margin">Cauſe.</note> and therefore thoſe fall into theſe Fevers which are of ſuch an age and nature as that their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies are moiſter, as children and infants, as alſo old men and ſuch as have groſſer bodies, and are given to their bellies and to idleneſs, and dwell in moiſt places, but not young men and ſuch as are cholerick.</p>
                     <p>The ſigns of continued periodick Fevers are alſo manifeſt in this Fever, only the violence is moſt about the evening.
<note place="margin">Signs.</note> The heat firſt is gentle, a little afterwards more ſharp, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſeems to abate, and ſometimes to increaſe, by reaſon of the thickneſs of the phlegm which purriſieth. The pulſes are not ſo thick and frequent, the urine is not ſo fiery and red as in other Fevers but thicker, nor are the other Symptomes ſo vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as in other Fevers.</p>
                     <p>Concerning the event. 1.
<note place="margin">Progno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticks.</note> This Fever by reaſon of the thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the humour is long, and hard to be cured, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore dangerous. And by how much the thicker the phlegm is by ſo much the more violent and durable, ſo that it is not ended before the ſwetieth or ſixtieth day, and the beginning is ſcarce paſt before the twentieth. 2. It continueth leſſer time where many evacuations happen. That which is pure is alſo longer then that which is mixed with choller, and by how much the worſer Symptomes are preſent, and the ſtrength weaker, by ſo much the greater danger there is, which if they are not, health is to be hoped for. 3. By reaſon of the duration of the Fever, and weakneſs of the Liver, the ſick for the moſt part fall into Cachexy and Dropſie.</p>
                     <p>As to the cure this Fever is more dangerous in reſpect of the cauſe, then of its heat;
<note place="margin">Cure.</note> and therefore ſince it depends on phlegm that is to be heat, attenuated, cut, and afterwards being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocted and prepared, evacuated, and regard is to be had of the ſtrength, principally of the ſtomack and Liver.</p>
                     <p>Therefore in the beginning the ſtomack and firſt ways are to be opened and evacuated by Cliſters and lenitive medicines,
<note place="margin">Lenitives.</note> or elſe the matter inherent in the ſtomack is to be ejected by vomit.
<note place="margin">Opening a vein.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>But although the cauſe of this Fever be cold, yet becauſe it is mixed with blood and putrifieth, ſome blood may be taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way by opening of a vein, in caſe that the urine be thick and red, and that the ſtrength will bear it and the age, that nature may be eaſed of ſome part of her burthen.</p>
                     <p>Afterwards preparation &amp; concoction of the matter is to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavored with attenuating things which do not heat much;
<note place="margin">Preparing and alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</note> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:36866:273"/>in the beginning uſe Syrrup of Sorrel ſimple, with honey of roſes, Oxymel ſimple, Syrrup of Hyſop, Bittony, with the water or decoction of Maiden-hair, Sparagus, Graſs, Fennel, Hyſop, and medicines prepared of thoſe plants; alſo Spirit of Vitriol and Salt.</p>
                     <p>When any ſigns of concoction have appeared you may exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bite ſome gentle Purger of phlegm,
<note place="margin">Purging.</note> of Agarick, the leaves of Senna and ſuch like: Hence you muſt come to ſtronger prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and purging things, and ſo the matter which cannot be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vacuated at once, is to be prepared, concocted, and evacuated at ſeveral times. And becauſe a pure continued Quotidian ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom happens, but that either choller or melancholy is intermix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, we are to look to theſe humours alſo, and to adde Cichory, Burrage,

                     <p>After the greateſt part of the matter is evacuated, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder is to be emitted by urine and ſweat uſing ſuch medicines as occaſion the ſame.</p>

Yet if crudities be in the ſtomack and firſt paſſages by ſparing dyet the three firſt days they may be abated and conſumed, afterwards ſuch a dyet as we have mentioned may be obſerved.

Small beer is alſo convenient, when concoction appears, wine is more ſafely adminiſtred, whereby the concoction is aſſiſted, the ſtomack ſtrengthened, and the humours driven out by urine.</p>

Whence the Ancients, alſo as <hi>Galen</hi> teacheth, 4. <hi>Aphor.</hi> 73. ſaid thoſe only were fevouriſh, which were ſick without an inflammation or other diſtemper, but thoſe that did febricitate by reaſon of an inflammation of the ſide, lungs or any other part, they did not call them fevouriſh, but Pleure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick, Peripneumoniack, Hepatick, or other ſuch like names.</p>
                     <p>But there is not only one ſort of theſe Fevers,
<note place="margin">Differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</note> yet the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal and moſt uſual is that which follows an inflamation of ſome internal part neer the heart, or which hath conſent with the heart, when from blood powred into the inflamed part and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trifying, vapours are communicated to the heart, and heat it; which in a Pleuriſie, Peripneumony and Angina happens as we are commonly taught. But although it cannot be denied but that from the inflamation of theſe and other ſuch like parts Symptomatical Fevers may ariſe, and that the Fevers enſuing the inflammations in accidental wounds do prove it; yet if we diligently conſider it, all thoſe Fevers which are commonly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Symptomatical are not ſuch but primary.</p>

And it is manifeſt by this, becauſe a Fever for the moſt part precedes inflammation it doth not follow it, and oftentimes the matter paſſeth from one part to another, whence changes of diſeaſes are made. Hence theſe Fevers are properly called by <hi>Platerus Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitatae</hi> rather then Symptomatical, and ſuch <hi>Febres Gomitatae</hi> are not only thoſe which have an inflammation of any part ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with them, but alſo thoſe, to which other evils are annexed, namely a Diarrhea, a Dyſentery, Spots, Meaſles, the ſmall Pox, wandring pains, the Gout of the joynts, or running Gout, Catarrhs.

                        <note place="margin">Eryſipelas or Roſe.</note> called by the Germans Roſe; for this Fever doth not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from an inflammation of an external part, but this evil ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companies the Fever; for when the thinner and hotter blood burneth in the veſſels by what means ſoever, putrifies, and is corrupted, and acquires a vitious quality, which principally is cauſed by anger, and fear, nature being ſtimulated protrudes the ſame to ſome external part of the body, whence this evil in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vadeth with a trembling and quaking, and whileſt the matter ſtriving to go outwards, ceaſeth on the Glandules under the Arm-pits, and about the groin; ſome of the humour that is ſtirred up, ſticks there, and pain and ſwellings are there percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, till at length it manifeſts it ſelf in the leg or ſome other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal part which may be known by the heat, pain, and roſie colour.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>To theſe belong the Fever that leaves fire as it were behind it, which burneth ſo exceedingly, that all the interals are as it were burnt, but the external parts grow cold, and that during the whole courſe of the diſeaſe; and this Fever ariſeth from an Eri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſipelas or inflamation of any internal part, but principally of the ſtomack, and from blood and Spirits meeting in the part infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond kind of Symptomatical Fevers which is called <hi>Lenta,</hi> proceeds not from any inflamation of the bowels,
<note place="margin">Febre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentae.</note> but from ſome obſtruction and hidden putrefaction, that is, from matter without the veſſels, ſpread over the ſubſtance of any of the interals, or at leaſt impacted, and putrifying in the capillar veins diſperſed neer the ſubſtance of the interals, and hath its riſe from the ſubſtance of the interal decaying; whence there is ſo great quantity as that when the matter is gotten into larger and wider veſſels, vapours cannot be tranſmitted to the heart, and ſo a <hi>Febris Lenta</hi> is ſtirred up, which therefore is unequal and keeps no certain order.</p>
                     <p>This Fever is the gentleſt of all, and moleſteth not the ſick with any grievous Symptome, ſo that the ſick oftentimes thinks himſelf well. In the mean while the ſtrength decayes, that the ſick can ſcarce go forward, and the body is no ways refreſhed by aliment, but waſteth by degrees, whence ſometimes this Fever is accounted with an Hectick, and therefore when there is any ſuſpition of this Fever, in the firſt place we muſt diligently ſearch the Hypocondries and Hypogaſtries, to try whether any tumor be to be diſcerned in any of them; ſome ſigns of putrefaction alſo will appear in the urine, and diſcover themſelves in the Pulſe.</p>
                     <p>This Fever is more durable, and goes beyond the terms of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Fevers, and often endeth not in fourty days, nor is it gone until the humour faſtened to the interal be conſumed.</p>
                     <p>The third ſort of Symptomatical Fevers is,
<note place="margin">Fevers from pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trefaction of interals.</note> that which ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth from the putrefaction of any interal, from whence putred vapours through the veins inſerted might be ſent to the heart, heat that, and might ſtir up a continued Fever, whereby the body by degrees might be extenuated and wither. And this Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver is ſometimes more violent, ſometimes more mild, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:36866:276"/>as the putrefaction is more or leſs. This often happens in putrefaction of the lungs in ſuch as are Phthiſical; ſo 'tis found that the Caul or Kell, Meſentery, Womb, and other parts are corrupted, and thence a Fever kindled. In like manner from Fiſtulaes penetrating into the internal parts a <hi>Febris lenta</hi> being ſtirred up, it is obſerved, that ſome do conſume and waſte.</p>
                     <p>The fourth kind of Symptomatical Fevers is when either from corrupt milk,
<note place="margin">From cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt milk.

                     <p>To theſe may be referred that Fever which ariſeth from crudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which is familiar amongſt little children from their eating of ſweet things, which hath with it a tumor and inflammation of the Hypocondries, which the Germans call <hi>Das Herngeſpam,</hi> from the abundance of crude humours collected in the ſtomack and neighbouring parts, which begin to putrefie and are turned into wind.

                     <p>Symptomatical Fevers properly ſo called, are known by this, that they come after diſeaſes of private parts, and the firſt ſort of theſe Fevers is known from hence, becauſe it follows an inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of ſome certain part: as on the contrary, Fevers called <hi>Comitatae,</hi> firſt appear and invade with rigor and trembling, to which afterwards a Fever happens.</p>
                     <p>But thoſe <hi>Lentae</hi> or ſlow Fevers are known by their ſlow heat, wherewith notes of putrefaction in the urine and pulſe appear, the ſick are weak ſcarce able to go, the body waſteth by little and little, and the Fever is lengthened for the moſt part beyond four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty days; they are tormented by the uſe of purging. But when the cauſe of theſe Fevers is hidden, 'tis very hardly to be diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed, and therefore the Hypocondries and other internal parts are to be obſerved with great diligence, and we are to enquire whether any tumor or pain be to be found there.</p>
                     <p>But thoſe which ariſe from the putrefaction of any part are more eaſily known, nor indeed can the corruption of the part be hidden, unleſs it be ignoble.</p>
                     <p>So that Fever which proceeds from corrupt milk or blood is eaſily known by its ſigns; as alſo that which ariſeth from crudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is manifeſt from their loathing things blowing up and ſwelling of the Hypocondries.</p>
                     <p>Although theſe Fevers in reſpect of themſelves for the moſt part are not dangerous becauſe they are mild,
<note place="margin">The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnoſtick.</note> yet in regard of their cauſes on which they depend, we ought to doubt whether
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:36866:276"/>they are dangerous or not, as alſo whether they are long or ſhort; for thoſe which follow an inflammation of any part are ſhort; ſince that the inflammation it ſelf cannot be long, but the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of them depends on the inflammation.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Febres Lentae</hi> are for the moſt part long, and often con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue more then fourty days. And although not by their vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence yet by their duration they debilitate the ſtrength; they are cured alſo with difficulty, becauſe their cauſe pertinaciouſly inheres in ſome interal.</p>
                     <p>Thoſe Fevers are very dangerous and ſeldom curable which come from the corruption and putrefaction of any part; becauſe the part can ſeldom be cured.</p>
                     <p>But thoſe Fevers which proceed from corrupted mill: and blood, worms or crudity, are often acute and dangerous, and bring with them grievous Symptomes, as Epilepſies, Convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions; yet they laſt not long, neither are they hard to be cured, but the cauſe being taken away they ceaſe.</p>
                     <p>The way of cure ought to be aimed at by ſtriking at the cauſe whereon it depends.
<note place="margin">The Cure.</note> If therefore a Symptomatical Fever de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend on an inflammation of any part, the cure is to be directed to the inflammation it ſelf, which being cured, the Fever cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth. And therefore moſt remedies which are convenient to aſſwage inflammations are here uſeful. Yet in regard of the part affected, the way of cure ſometimes differs, the part affected is diligently to be weighed: Whereof it ſhall be ſpoken in the cure of particular affects.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Febres Lentae</hi> ſince they proceed from extraordinary ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions of the bowels, require opening, attenuating, and deterging medicines. And ſuch are to be choſen as are appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priated to each part, and ſuch as ſtrengthen the tone of the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals, which for the moſt part is debilitated, yet by intervalls gentle purgation may be uſed. Neither are Diureticks to be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in their ſeaſon. Externally alſo if the part affected will bear it, Emollients and Diſcutients are to be applied.</p>
                     <p>If the Symptomatical Fever proceed from the corruption and putrefaction of any part, that cure is to be inſtituted which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeth to Ulcers and Fiſtulaes of the internal parts.</p>
                     <p>If it be occaſioned by corrupt milk or blood, Worms, or crude and corrupt meats we are to endeavour that thoſe cauſes be taken away conveniently, either by vomit or cleanſing and evacuating medicines, and together to reſiſt putrefaction and fevouriſh heat.</p>
                     <p>In the cure of accompanied Fevers, we are to look no leſs to

                     <p>AFter continued Fevers, intermitting are to be explained.
<note place="margin">Intermit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers.</note> But although the Ancients did extend the name of inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting Fevers more largely, and attributed the ſame to all Fevers which admit of ſome change of heat, and are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times exaſperated, ſometimes remitted, and ſo to continued periodicks: yet afterwards uſe brought it to paſs that thoſe Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers only were called intermittent, which ſometimes ceaſe and come to that apurexy or want of fire.</p>
                     <p>The proximate cauſe of an intermitting Fever is a putred va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pour,
<note place="margin">their prox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imate cauſe.</note> elevated from the putrefaction of excrementitious hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, not continually as in continued Fevers, but by certain intervalls ſent to the heart, and heating the ſame contrary to na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
                     <p>But how it comes to paſs,
<note place="margin">The fire place of Intermit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers.</note> that the putred vapour is not conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually ſent to the heart but at certain times is very obſcure. For the explanation whereof ſince the knowledge of the place wherein putrefaction ariſeth, doth not a little conduce, and whence the putred vapours are communicated to the heart, which <hi>Galen</hi> calls the Furnace and Chimney in his 2. <hi>of the differences of Fevers,</hi> cap. the laſt, and in his 15. <hi>of the method of curing.</hi> cap. the fourth, that therefore is firſt to be explained. But ſince 'tis beyond the bounds of our Breviary of Inſtitutions to reckon up the various and different opinions of Phyſicians concerning it, we will here ſet down that opinion which we think trueſt. The Chimney or Furnace and place wherein the matter the cauſe of intermitting Fevers is generated, are the Meſaraick
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:36866:277"/>veins, wherein the matter which ſufficeth to irritate each ſingle Paroxiſm, is generated during the time of its interval. And that many things which happen about intermitting Fevers do prove; namely Loathing, Vomitting, Dolor of the heart, Extenſion and pain of the Midriffe, Intumeſcence about the Ventricle, Bitterneſs about the mouth, Belching, and ſuch like; for in the beginning of intermitting Fevers pure choller is often ejected by vomit in great abundance, which out of the more remote veins could not be evacuated in that manner, and about the cava of the Liver. <hi>Fernelius</hi> ſays he hath found the quantity of a pound by weight after the death of a Patient.</p>
                     <p>This choler being caſt out the Fever is often cured, which is a ſign that it is the cauſe of the Fever, and that it is collected in thoſe firſt ways or paſſages. Which Fomentations alſo uſed to the Hypocondries at the beginning of a Paroxyſm ſhews by the mitigation of the trembling and ſhaking.</p>
                     <p>This matter is gather'd together in the Meſaraick veins a long time before it brings forth a Fever, but when it begins to putre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie, grow hot, and be changed, its heat being diffuſed over the whole body it exciteth a Fever; which when it is diſperſed, the fevouriſh heat and Paroxiſm ceaſeth, and the Fever leaveth ſo long as till new matter which in like manner putrifieth in its due time, is generated.</p>
                     <p>But although the matter which is the cauſe of intermitting Fevers be generated in the Meſaraick veins and firſt paſſages:

                           <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na cava.</note> Yet the whole doth not reſide and continue included in them, but is ſent to the vena cava and arteries, both during the fit and out of the ſame. Nor is it here neceſſary to ſeek for occult and blind paſſages, through which the putred vapours ſhould be ſent to the heart during the Paroxiſm, ſince there are manifeſt paſſages enough; for the branches of the Gate-vein are inſerted into the ſubſtance of the Liver, and the mouths of theſe have communion with the vena cava, and the arteries going from the heart are joyned in the ſtomack, guts, ſpleen and other parts to the Meſaraick veins. Yet 'tis probable that the fevouriſh mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter may be communicated to the veins not principally and only in the Paroxiſm, but moreover ſome part thereof by that paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage which is from the Meſeraick veins to the Liver continually may be carried to them; whence both by <hi>Galen.</hi> 1. <hi>de criſ. cap.</hi> 7. and other Phyſicians a Fever is called a paſſion of a venemous nature. And that is firſt manifeſt from the urines, which ſhew evident notes of crudity and concoction in Intermittents. Hence alſo it comes to paſs that urines during the Paroxiſms are lauda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:36866:278"/>and like to theirs who are well, ſince that the peccant humor is then protruded by nature out of the veins towards the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of the body, and ſo the blood in the veins is become pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, which again in the intervals of fits is polluted by the vitious humour proceeding from the chimney of the Fever. The ſame is manifeſt out of thoſe things which happen at the beginning of a fit, and at that time which the Greeks call Epiſemaſian; for then ſpontaneous laſſitudes, ſtretching, compreſſion of pulſes, and other things happen which indicate that the matter which is to ſtir the Fever begins to be moved and as it were to ſwell in thoſe common veſſels, veins and arteries.</p>
                     <p>That vitious humour accumulated partly in the Meſaraick veins, partly in the vena cava when in time it putrifieth, nature ſtimulated and irritated oftentimes ſtrives ſeveral ways, firſt by vomit and ſtool, afterwards by ſweats and urine ſenſibly to eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuate the ſame, as alſo through the pores of the skin, and by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible tranſpiration it may diſcuſs the ſame being reſolved into vapours and ſteam. For ſince that peccant humour is not exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mingled with the blood but confuſedly, nature may eaſily ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate the ſame from the good blood, and may ſhake it off each ſingle fit; which being diſcuſſed, ſince putred vapours cannot any more be communicated to the heart, the Fever alſo ceaſeth and apurexie enſueth.</p>
                     <p>But becauſe that as long as the Fever continueth ſome ſeeds and ſparks are left in the granary and chimney,
<note place="margin">Cauſes of the return of fits.</note> and ſeeing that there is imbecillity in the part, 'tis neceſſary that the humour flowing to it, although it be good, ſhould be defiled with that pollution and excrement which was left as it were with leaven, and through the debility of the part be corrupted, and ſo new matter of a future Paroxiſm be generated. And theſe fits conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue, and ſo often return, until that thoſe ſeeds, that putrefacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and thoſe ſparks are fully taken away from thence, and the weakneſs of that part reſtored.

But what the reaſon is why theſe Fevers return at ſet times, ſome ſooner, ſome
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:36866:278"/>later, is now another queſtion, and that moſt intricate, which is eaſier to ask then anſwer? But that we may here forbear to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite the opinions of others, which are very many, we will men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion only that which ſeems moſt probable to us, ſo far as in this humane dimneſs of our underſtanding in ſo obſcure a buſineſs we are able to diſcover. And firſt, that Fevers keep ſuch certain periods, experience doth manifeſt; whereby it appeareth, that ſome Fevers return the third, ſome the fourth day, and that oftentimes it obſerves not only the ſame hour, but minute of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſion although the fits may ſomtimes anticipate, ſomtimes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tard for certain reaſons. But the cauſe why paroxiſms return at certain times, we conceive is to be ſought from the diverſity of humours: For thoſe effects, as <hi>Valleriola</hi> ſaith, in any one ſort of things, which perpetually agree to the things, and are made in the like manner, into what body, and at what time ſoever they happen to come, theſe are to be referred to the proper ſubſtance of that of the which they are made; but to make return through certain days, and to irritate acceſſions, both agrees perpetually to humors and the recourſes in this manner, alwaies at equal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervals (unleſs a perverting of the order of periods happen from elſe-where) are made: Therefore it ſhall be from ſuch or ſuch a nature of humours that the recourſe ſhall be made in the ſame ſort; namely, the cauſes of periods and intermitting Fevers, are excrementitious humours. <hi>Choler, Melancholy; Flegme;</hi> and thoſe Fevers which return the third day, proceed from a Chole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick humour; thoſe on the fourth from Melancholy; thoſe that come every day, ſo that they are not double Tertians, proceed from Flegme.</p>
                     <p>Yet the cauſe of periods cannot be drawn ſimply from hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, but as they acquire a peculiar quality from putrefaction or corruption, by reaſon whereof at a certain time, they wax hot and begin to be moved. For ſithence this effect is definite and determinate, which carries it ſelf alike in all individuals, 'tis neceſſary that it have a certain definite and determinate cauſe in all individuals that are alike; which ſince that neither diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of parts, nor quantity of humours (for we ſee that although the ſtore of matter decreaſeth, and the fits are become ſhorter, nevertheleſs they do return at their uſual time) nor manifeſt quality of humour, thickneſs, viſcidity, tenuity, or ſome ſuch like, which uſeth to vary, can be a quality; we muſt needs fly to a peculiar and proper quality and nature of a humour; which alſo when it is changed, the form of the Fever it ſelf is changed; for when Choler is turned into Melancholy, the Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:36866:279"/>which uſed to come the third day, cometh on the fourth; and this quality alſo may afterwards remain in the humour, when the putrefaction ceaſeth, and the Fever depending thereon. Whence, as <hi>Fornelius</hi> in his to of Fevers witneſſeth, the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Cholick, Pains of the Joynts, and ſuch like diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes ariſing after long continued Tertians and Quartans, do likewiſe keep certain periods, by reaſon of that diſpoſition which they have received from the corruption or putrefaction of the humours.</p>
                     <p>Yet if any one be willing to determine that the ſaid occult pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety is derived,
<note place="margin">Order of the fits</note> not from corruption only, but that celeſtial cauſes do alſo concur to its generation, I will not much contend with him; for we ſee that principally about the Solſtices and Aequinoctials, ſuch Fevers, eſpecially the moſt durable of them, do begin and end.</p>
                     <p>But although Fevers keep certain periods, yet there is a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain difference in them alſo; for ſomtimes the fit returns juſt at the expected time: ſomtimes the following paroxiſme returns ſooner then the former; which form is called <hi>proleptick:</hi> ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the following fit comes later then the former, and that form is called <hi>Hysterick;</hi> and indeed ſomtimes through the whole courſe of the diſeaſe, ſuch a form is obſerved, and often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times from the beginning of a Fever, until the end of the ſame the paroxiſmes anticipate, or come after the expected time: but ſomtimes in ſome there is anticipation, in ſome poſt pofition, otherwiſe the fits comes at the ſame time.</p>

But the fits return flower, when the matter is diminiſhed, or thickned: Which indeed when the accuſtomary paroxiſme is changed, that it may be ſo, as we do not deny; ſo when the Fever keeps al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ſome certain form, either proleptick or hyſterick, the cauſe rather ſeems to be taken from the diverſity of the humour; for although Choler, according to its manner, being corrupted, is the cauſe of a Tertian, Melancholy of a Quartan; yet Choler and Melancholy, according to the diverſity of Bodies and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peraments, do oftentimes vary ſomthing; Hence alſo it happens, that although that putred leaven, or occult quality introduced by choler, be the cauſe of the circuit of a Tertian, Melancholy being brought in of a Quartan: yet according to the difference of a humour, it may happen ſo, that the efferveſcence, or ferven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of humours, may come ſooner or later by ſome hours.</p>

                     <p>Concerning the longitude or brevity of ſome Paroxiſms that depends on the paucity or plenty of matter,
<note place="margin">The cauſe of the length of Fits.</note> diſpoſition of the humours and body: For a plentiful quantity of humours is the cauſe of a longer fit then a ſmall; ſo a thick humour cauſeth a longer then a thin, ſince it cannot be ſo ſoon diſcuſſed as a thin. If the ſtrength of the body be great, which can more eaſily diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſs what is offenſive, then theirs who are weak; the ſhorter fit followeth: Alſo a thinner conſtitution of body, as being more apt for the diſcuſſing of the matter, is the cauſe of a ſhorter fit; a thicker, of a longer. And when all the cauſes which occaſion a ſhort paroxiſm concur, a very ſhort fit is raiſed: But when all thoſe that produce a long are preſent, the paroxiſm is extream long. When certain cauſes are preſent which make a ſhort fit, and ſome are wanting of them, an indifferent betwixt both hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens.</p>
                     <p>And ſo much of the nature, place, and motion of the proxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate cauſe, which exciteth intermittent Fevers;
<note place="margin">The more remote cauſes of intermit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers.</note> But the more remote cauſes, and thoſe things which conduce to the generation and corruption of that matter in the Meſeraick veins, are meat and drink of evil juice, but yeilding matter for peccant humours anſwering to their own nature; and an ill diſpoſition of ſtomack, whereof meats turn into choler, or become ſour, an intemperate conſtitution of Ayr; for although divers humours are generated in different bodies naturally, yet if there be great vehemency of manifeſt cauſes, even in bodies of different conſtitutions, they may produce the ſame humours and diſeaſes depending on them.</p>
                     <p>As for the difference of intermitting Fevers,
<note place="margin">Difference.</note> they proceed from the diverſity of humours; for there are ſo many ſorts of inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting Fevers, as there are of humours by which they are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced; for there are according to the vulgar opinion, three ſorts of excrementitious humours, <hi>Choler, Flegme,</hi> and <hi>Melancholy,</hi> and ſo three kinds of intermitting Fevers, <hi>Bilious, Pituitous,</hi> and <hi>Melancholy;</hi> which differences we uſually call a Tertian in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termittent, a quotidian intermittent, and a quartane intermit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent. And in caſe thoſe humours are ſincere, pure Fevers are generated; if they are mixed, ſpurious. And that Fever which proceeds from pure Choler, is called a pure Tertian, but that which ariſeth from yellow Choler mixt with ſome other humour, is called a Baſtard Tertian.</p>
                     <p>But concerning a quotidian intermittent,
<note place="margin">Of a quoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther any be.</note> the matter is not ſo plain: For <hi>Fernelius</hi> accounts this the rareſt of all other, and ſcarce one of them happens amongſt ſix hundred; and that thoſe intermittent Fevers which daylie afflict, for the moſt part he rather
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:36866:280"/>accounts them double Tertians: But <hi>Platerus</hi> flatly denies a Quotidian Fever, and wholly agreeth with <hi>Galen</hi> 8. <hi>Meth. med. cap.</hi> 5. where he appoints only a twofold crudity; the one ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous, the other acid: and they only ſeem to afford matter for two ſorts of Fevers, Cholerick and Melancholy. For although Flegme alſo, according to preheminency, and moſt principally, be called a crude humour; yet ſince it is exceeding cold, it can ſcarcely putrifie and excite a Fever.</p>
                     <p>But whether there are more circuits of Fevers,
<note place="margin">Whether there are Quintan Fevers.</note> and whether beſides Tertians, Quartans, and if there be any ſuch thing as Quotidians, there are alſo other Fevers which are extended be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the fifth circuit, is doubtful. <hi>Galen</hi> ſaw no ſuch: Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs <hi>Hypocrates,</hi> and other Phyſitians, obſerved Fevers which returned the fifth, ſixth, ſeventh, eighth, ninth day: But what the cauſe of this courſe is, is very obſcure. Some ſeek the cauſe of ſuch fits out of the diverſe conſtitution of Choler and Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly; and <hi>Andreas Caeſalpinus Art. Med. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 15. re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers Quintans to Choler, Septanes to Melancholy; and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines ſuch flower returns of Fits to be a kind of renewing of one or more ſimple acceſſions; and the Quintan to be a kind of Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian, wherein the third day is without a paroxiſm; and a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptan to be a ſort of Quartan, renewing the acceſſion of the fourth day. But moſt derive the reaſon of theſe circuits from the vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous mixture of Melancholy humours with others. But although it be probable that all theſe Fevers, as keeping longer periods, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from a Melancholy humour; yet a mixture of that humour ſeems not neceſſary: Becauſe no humour can be appointed to be mixed with a Melancholy, which can be a cauſe of a ſlower peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>od then it ſelf: for thoſe humours, both Cholerick and Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly, are not alwaies of the ſame ſort; and moreover, the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption alſo which they ſuffer, is not alwaies the ſame; ſo that it is no wonder that the effect alſo varies, which proceeding from them is not alwaies the ſame: And as in epidemical diſeaſes, ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times rare and wonderful corruptions of humours happen, ſo in Intermittents, that ſome ſuch thing may likewiſe happen, is not altogether abſurd.</p>
                     <p>Intermitting Fevers are eaſily known;
<note place="margin">Diagno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stick ſigns.</note> for they come to Apu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rexie, and at certain times; and indeed, as <hi>Galen</hi> 1. <hi>ad Glaucan. cap.</hi> 5.2. <hi>de criſib. cap.</hi> 3. <hi>&amp;</hi> 2. <hi>de diff.

<pb n="53" facs="tcp:36866:280"/>are really intermittent, they are not pure; whoſe Idea <hi>Galen</hi> propounds but ſpurious.</p>
                     <p>But theſe Fevers are leſs dangerous then continued;
<note place="margin">Progno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticks.</note> and ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, unleſs the ſtrength be decayed, or in regard of age, or ſome other cauſe, or ſome errour committed in diet, are mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, ſithence it may be convenient during the apurexie to gather ſtrength, and adminiſter neceſſary medicines.</p>
                     <p>Concerning the cure of theſe Fevers in general:
<note place="margin">Indicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Cure</note> Since their cauſe is collected and generated in the meſeraick veins, there pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trifies, and thence is diffuſed over all the body, and at length is diſcuſſed by inſenſible tranſpiration or ſweats: But the cauſe of the recourſe of the Fever, as <hi>Galen</hi> teacheth, 2. <hi>de Febr. cap.</hi> the laſt is a twofold vitious diſpoſition in a body, the one a certain pollution or putrifaction left after the former paroxiſme; the other imbecility of the member or part, generating excrementi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious humours; what therefore is to be done in each ſort of Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, eaſily appears from hence.</p>
                     <p>For ſithence the beginning of generation and corruption of humours producing a Fever, is in the firſt paſſages,
<note place="margin">Purging</note> we are to endeavour to purge out that peccant humour, before it corrupts the reſt of the blood, and brings weakneſs, and a vitious diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to the parts; but we muſt proceed warily in thoſe evacua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, ſince there is not the ſame reaſon of all intermitting Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers: For when that vitious and excrementious humour, the cauſe of a Fever, in the meſeraicks is mixed with blood, crudity alſo, and concoction, according to their manner are neceſſary; whereby the vitious humours may be ſeparated from the good, and rendred fit for evacuation: and that often happens in a ſhort time in Fevers full of Choler, and the cholerick humour is other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe apt enough to motion: But in a Quartan the humour is more ſtubborn, and moreover according to <hi>Galen</hi> 1. <hi>ad Glau. cap.</hi> 11. no ſtrong medicine is eaſily to be admitted at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning.</p>
                     <p>And Sudorifiques are not at all (or altogether) to be uſed,
<note place="margin">Sweats</note> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs evacuations have preceded; for if many vitious and excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentitious humours do hitherto abide in the firſt ways, it may eaſily come to paſs that by reaſon of hydroticks untimely exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited, they may be detruded thence to the more noble parts, and may become the cauſe of various and grievous evils, and ſuch as may bring more danger then the Fever it ſelf.</p>
                     <p>As for breathing of a vein,
<note place="margin">Letting blood.</note> 'tis not indicated from the prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry cauſe of intermitting Fevers, which is generated in the meſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raick veins, where the greateſt part abideth: Yet becauſe that
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:36866:281"/>ſomtimes blood alſo abounds, which may eaſily be corrupted and polluted by the vitious humours, and ſo if it be too plentiful, cannot be well governed by nature when it is weakned by a Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; and in the progreſs of the diſeaſe, from thence ſome of the peccant matter paſſeth into the vena cava, and is mixed with the blood, it is ſomtimes needful to open a vein, which nevertheleſs is not to be appointed preſently in the beginning, before the eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuation of the primary paſſages.</p>
                     <p>If the Fever be not cured by theſe evacuations, we are to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour that the cauſes of the returns of fits may be taken away, and moreover two things remain to be done; namely, that that diſpoſition and weakneſs of the part generating vitious humours, may be taken away, which is performed by altering medicines, which together correct the fault of the humour, and diſcuſs that pollution, and thoſe ſeeds which were left out of the putrifacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of humours: and indeed that paroxiſms depend on that pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, and that when it is taken away the Fever ceaſeth, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth from hence, That whilſt that is driven by nature to the circumference of the body, out of the veins, and that Puſtules are raiſed about the lips, noſe, and other parts of the face, the Fever ceaſeth

                     </p>
                     <p>But 'tis principally taken away by Sudorifiques; yet there are alſo certain other medicines known both to Phyſitians and to the vulgar,
<note place="margin">Febrifuga.</note> which take away feveriſh fits, and therefore are called <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brilia, Puretagoga,</hi> and ſuch as ſpecifically cauſe, and are called The flight of a Fever, or <hi>Febrifuga,</hi> which nevertheleſs cauſe no ſweat, but without doubt ſome other way take away that ſeed, and by conſequence the paroxiſm, ſuch as commonly are accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the powder of burnt ſhells of Cockles or Snails or of the Pearl bearing ſhels, or mother of pearl calcined, of River Crabs, and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally their eyes, which are ſo called prepared, and ſuch like: But how they perform this, is not explained by Authors. That I may ſpeak my own opinion, ſuch like medicines ſeem by a certain precipitation to take away that force of heating and ſtirring up a paroxiſm which is in the humours, to which Opiats ſeem to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long: yet ſuch like cannot be given ſafely, unleſs the vitious humours, and thoſe things which may afford the reaſon of the antecedent cauſe be firſt taken away; for otherwiſe thoſe things which may be expell'd by nature when it is irritated in a paro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xiſme, are left in the body, and afterwards may become the cauſe of a Chachexie, Dropſie, Jaundies, Cholick pains, and of other gri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </head>
                     <p>AFter we have handled intermitting Fevers in general,
<note place="margin">An inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting Tertian.</note> we will now go through them in particular; amongſt them the moſt frequent is a Tertian intermitting, which ariſeth from Choler putrifying in the meſeraick veins.</p>
                     <p>But there is a certain difference of theſe Fevers; for firſt,
<note place="margin">Its differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</note> Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler it ſelf out of which theſe Fevers are generated, is not of the ſame kind; for ſomtimes the choler is like to that natural cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler which afterwards is collected in the Galls bladder; ſomtimes it is preternatural green and aeruginous, ſuch as ſomtimes by thoſe that are Feveriſh, is evacuated by vomit or ſtool. Moreover, Choler either putrifies alone, or elſe hath ſome other humour mixt with it; Flegme or Melancholy that cauſeth a pure, this a baſtard Tertian. They differ alſo in reſpect of duration; for if the fits are not extended beyond twelve hours, they are wont to be called pure tertians; but in caſe the Fit be extended above twelve hours, they are no more called exquiſite and pure tertians, but either ſimply tertians, or ſpurious tertians; and when the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roxiſm is extended above twenty four hours, they are called ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſe tertians; but this is occaſioned either by the thinneſs or thickneſs, plenty or paucity of the humour. For by how much the Choler is thinner or leſſer, by ſo much the ſooner 'tis diſcuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, but by how much the thicker, or more mixed with thick humours, or the more plentiful, by ſo much the longer the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roxiſm continueth.</p>
                     <p>The cauſes of this Fever are all thoſe things which can gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate excrementitious choler, namely a hot and dry diſtemper;
<note place="margin">The cauſes genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, Choler ſigns of a true Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian.</note> hot conſtitution of ayr, cating of hot meats, and drinking of hot drinks, uſing of hot medicines, watching, faſting, labour, and too much exerciſe: For although that in the Liver alſo yellow choler may be generated, yet it is very often generated by the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of the firſt concoction, and fault of the meſeraick vein; therefore whether much choler be generated in the ſtomack by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:36866:282"/>of meats, or by default of the ſtomack, and is carried to the meſeraick veins with the chyle, and there is heaped up, and at length putrifieth, a Fever is kindled.</p>
                     <p>If the cauſes generating Flegme and Melancholy be annexed to thoſe that generate choler, ſpurious tertians are bred.</p>
                     <p>This Fever preſently invadeth,
<note place="margin">A pure Tertian.</note> if it be pure, with a ſhaking fit, as it were pricking the fleſh; afterwards when the cold fit ceaſeth, preſently much heat followeth, ſharp and biting, and in its vigour is extended equally over the body, whence the ſick draw their breath much, and are troubled with thirſt. The pulſes in the beginning of a fit are little, weak, ſlow, and thin; but the fit increaſing, they become vehement, ſwift, frequent, and in ſome meaſure hard, and void of all inequalities beſides Feveriſh. When the fit comes to the height, and the ſick drinks, many vapours are ſent through the skin, vomiting of choler followeth, which of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes uſeth to happen after the cold fit alſo, the belly is looſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, choler is piſſed out, or ſomtimes more then theſe happen. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards a ſweating out of hot vapours enſueth over the whole body, and the pulſe is ſwift, great, vehement, ſuch as theirs uſe to be who are over-heated by exerciſe. The Urine is of a light red, or deep yellow, and afterwards hath a white cloud or ſuſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. The fit laſteth not above twelve hours, and the cauſes which generate melancholy, have either gone before, or are then preſent.</p>
                     <p>A baſtard tertian is known from the cauſes which do not ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate pure choler,
<note place="margin">A ſpurious Tertian.</note> but to gather Flegm or Melancholy: The heat is not ſo ſharp as in a pure tertian, but more mild, neither is it preſently diffuſed over the whole body. Neither is this Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver diſſolved by vomitting of yellow choler, or by ſweat, but cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain vapours go out in the declination, and if any ſweats come forth, they either are not univerſal, or if they are univerſal, they cure not the Fever. The Urine is not ſo fiery as in a pure tertian, and the ſigns of concoction do not appear ſo ſoon in it. The pulſe in the beginning is hard, and that hardneſs increaſeth daylie, until the ſeventh paroxiſm, then by degrees it becomes ſofter, and the Urines alſo appear more concocted. The paro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xiſm is often extended to eighteen hours and more: yet ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, to wit if the matter be leſs, and Nature ſtrong, it is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe terminated in twelve hours. It endeth not in ſeven fits, but often endureth till it comes to fourteen, and ſomtimes to twenty.</p>
                     <p>But theſe Fevers are leaſt dangerous amongſt all the putred ones 4.

Somtimes they are terminated at the third or fourth fit; but ſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious tertians, as they are more frequent, ſo they continue long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er: for although if the matter be little, and neceſſary medicines are timely exhibited, they ſomtimes ceaſe at the fifth or ſeventh paroxiſm, yet for the moſt part they ſcarce end at fourteen fits, and are often lengthned out to the fortieth day; ſomtimes they continue ſix moneths, and end with ſome diſeaſe of the Liver or Spleen, or elſe are alſo ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Although Tertians for the moſt part are not dangerous, yet ſomtimes they become pernitious. Firſt, If any errour be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by the ſick, or the Phyſitian. Secondly, If the humour which Nature endeavours to expel, ſhould fall upon any princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal part. Thirdly, If the humour be exceeding thin, putred, or filthy. Fourthly, If a thin humour have a thick one mixed with it, and ſtir the ſame, and enflame it. Fifthly, If a thick humour poured out by heat, either fall down into ſome principal part, or cauſe a dangerous Catarrh, or Aſthma, or the Gout, or draw the womb into conſent. Sixthly, If the humour acquire a malignant quality.</p>
                     <p>But in the cure of this Fever, as alſo in others,
<note place="margin">Indicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Cure.</note> regard muſt be had of the Fever, the cauſe and nature of it; the Fever indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates cooling and moiſtning things, the ſame Choler alſo, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the cauſe requireth, which alſo ought to be evacuated: yet if another humour be mixed with it, altering preparing and eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuating medicines, which that humour requires, are to be mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and becauſe the abundance of the matter is in the meſeraick veins, the vitious humour is to be purged out of them, and if need be, prepared before it infect the good blood: afterwards alſo it is to be altered, and the diſpoſition of the part generating peccant humours to be corrected. Laſtly, We muſt endeavour that the pollution and putrifaction may be diſcuſſed by Sudori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiques.</p>
                     <p>Firſt therefore, the firſt paſſages are to be cleanſed,
<note place="margin">Purgers.</note> either by Clyſters, or lenitive Medicines exhibited of the Syrup of Roſes ſolutive, Manna, Caſſia, to which alſo we may add Rhubarb, Agarick, the leaves of Senna, according as the quality of the peccant humour requires. Vomits alſo convenient may be giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en, eſpecially if the ſick be troubled with pain in the heart, loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and a deſire to vomit: And ſince the matter conſiſts in the meſeraick veins, and that nature her ſelf at the beginning of the paroxiſm ſtrives to expel it either by vomit or ſtool, the Phyſician ought to be obſervant to it, and to eject the matter, if Nature
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:36866:283"/>endeavour to expel it by ſtool or vomit; and becauſe the matter for the moſt part in the firſt paſſages is either more abundant, or hath thick humours mixed therewith, there is need not only of lenitives, but thoſe medicines alſo which we lately mentioned; nay ſomtimes of ſome of the Electuary of Fleawort or Fleabane, of the juice of Roſes, Roſati Meſuae: Yet care muſt be taken that we do not draw the humours out of the veins into the firſt paſſages.</p>
                     <p>Concerning the opening of a vein,

                     <p>THe ſecond ſort of intermitting Fevers is that which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from Flegm,
<note place="margin">A Quoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian Fever</note> which becauſe it takes them every day, is called a quotidian. <hi>Fernelius</hi> writes that this is the rareſt of all Fevers, and that which ſcarce happens once a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt ſix hundred: Nay there are ſome who plainly deny it: and although many are affected every day, yet they are ſick of a double Tertian, or treble Quartan.</p>
                     <p>The cauſe of this Fever ſithence it is Flegm putrifying in the meſeraick veins, all thoſe things may be cauſes of this Fever,
<note place="margin">The cauſe</note> which conduce to the generation of Flegm, namely, weakneſs of the bowels, eſpecially of the ſtomack, heat, cold and moiſt aliment, and too great plenty of them.</p>
                     <p>This Fever is known by the cauſes generating Flegm which went before,
<note place="margin">Diagno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick ſigns.</note> and alſo by the ſigns of Flegm abounding in the body, explained in <hi>lib.</hi> 3. of <hi>Inſtitutions part.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 2, This Fever chiefly comes to invade in the night, only with coldneſs of the extreme parts, and trembling: The heat after refrigeration ſlowly invades, ſo that ſomtimes heat, ſomtimes cold is percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; and the heat at the firſt doth not ſeem ſharp, but habituous; yet if the hand put thereunto continue ſome time, it appears a little ſharp, and when it is diffuſed over the whole body, it doth not burn much, ſo that the ſick do not breath extraordinarily, neither are they very thirſty: The face is not very red, but for the moſt part yellowiſh, or a little puffed up; the eyes in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning are white, thin, and crude; afterwards when the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is concocted, they become thick, troubled, and oftentimes alſo red. In the firſt paroxiſms alſo they ſweat not, but in the progreſs of the diſeaſe they ſweat a little; the Pulſe alſo is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding little, thin, and more then in Quartans, but equally ſlow; the paroxiſm is extended to eighteen hours, and the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val, which is ſix hours, is ſeldome pure and free; nay 'tis often extended to four and twenty hours.</p>
                     <p>But how long this Fever ſhall continue,
<note place="margin">Progno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticks.</note> may be conjectured by the ſigns of concoction appearing ſooner or later in the Urine, and by the longitude and brevity of the paroxiſm; for if nature timely aim at ſome evacuation, it affords hopes of ſhortneſs of the diſeaſe: But this Fever as being that which ariſeth from a pertinacious humour is long, and continueth unto forty days
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:36866:285"/>three moneths or more, and is not without danger; and when the Stomack and Liver are much affected with it, the ſick are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten caſt into a Dropſie and Cachexy.</p>
                     <p>The cure for the moſt part is the ſame with a Quotidian con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued;
<note place="margin">The Cure</note> for the pituitous humour is to be prepared and evacua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, to wit, the firſt paſſages are to be opened with Cliſters ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodated to the pituitous humour; breathing a vein is ſcarce uſed, but a Vomit is more uſeful then in any other ſort of Fever, becauſe the ſtomack is principally affected, but 'tis to be occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned by ſeed of Radiſh, Orach, of Dill, flowers of Broom, in thoſe that are ſtrong, with Spurge, and others that are every where known.</p>
                     <p>The Flegmatick humour is to be prepared with convenient medicines;
<note place="margin">Preparers.</note> the opening roots, Hyſop, wilde Marjoram, Betony, Mayden hair, Agrimony, Groundpine, Camomil, and other things convenient for Flegm, Syrup of Sorrel ſimple and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound, Syrup of the two and of the five Roots, Honey of Roſes, Syrup Byzant, ſimple and compound, of Hyſop, Oxymel ſimple and compound with Squills, ſpirit of Salt and Vitriol.</p>

<note place="margin">A Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan.</note> and ſeizeth on the fourth day alſo, whence it is called a Quartan.</p>
                     <p>The proximate cauſe of a Quartan Fever is a melancholy humour collected in the meſeraick veins about the ſpleen and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jacent Bowels,
<note place="margin">The cauſe</note> and there putrifying, and that ſomtimes natural by its own nature cold and dry, and ſomtimes it participates with ſome aduſtion; But the more remote cauſes are, all thoſe things which conduce to the generation of black and melancholy hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, namely meats and drinks apt to generate this humour; amongſt the which is vinegar, of the which <hi>Hypocrates</hi> 3. <hi>vich.
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:36866:285"/>rat. in acut. t.</hi> 38. writeth, it attenuateth melancholy humours, raiſeth them, and frames many viſions in the mind: For Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar is a Leader or ſtirrer of Melancholy. The time is princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally in Autumn, eſpecially if a hot Summer have preceded.</p>
                     <p>This Fever is known by its quartane circuit,
<note place="margin">Signs,</note> and ſigns of melancholy abounding in the body, and it invadeth with a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain unequal diſturbance of the body, the which a cold ſhaking fit followeth, which at the firſt is little, or at leaſtwiſe inſtead thereof there is at the firſt refrigeration and horrour, in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs of the diſeaſe the cold paroxiſm is alwaies greater, and at length moſt vehement with pain, cauſing the bones to knock to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. The heat is kindled by degrees, neither is it burning, but ſomwhat milde. The pulſe is thin and ſlow, and although in the vigour of the paroxiſm it become ſwift and frequent, yet in compariſon of Tertians it is thin and ſlow. The Urines at firſt are thin and white, but in the progreſs of time higher co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loured and thicker. Sweats in the beginning are not frequent, but in the progreſs of the diſeaſe plentiful.</p>
                     <p>And thus things are in a pure quartan, but in a baſtard one tokens of ſome humour mixed do appear, and heat, thirſt, watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and other ſymptomes are more grievous.</p>
                     <p>This Fever continueth the longeſt of all other,
<note place="margin">Progno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticks.</note> and oftentimes is not only extended to ſome moneths, but years; and if it be not gone by the next ſolſtice or aequinectial, after it was firſt ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, it laſteth for the moſt part till the next after, and for the moſt part goes away in the Spring.

                     <p>The firſt paſſages of the Body therefore are firſt to be evacuated with cliſters, lenitive medicines, and vomits alſo; afterwards in caſe blood abound therewith, a vein is to be opened; and in caſe it iſſue forth black and thick, the greater quantity is to be taken, that by this means both the plenty of blood may be diminiſhed, and that part of the melancholy humour which is poured out in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the vena cava may be evacuated; but if the blood coming forth appear to be thin and yellow, 'tis forthwith to be ſtopped: And indeed where there is ſtore of blood (the firſt paſſages being cleanſed) a vein may be opened; but if this Fever begin with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſtore of blood, a vein is not to be breathed preſently at the beginning, but when ſome of the peccant humour is drawn into the veins, and mingled with the blood: The Baſilick or median vein either may be opened, moſt commend the opening of the Salvatella; yet they have not as yet rendered any ſufficient rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why that ſhould be preferred before others.</p>

                     <p>As concerning diet, it ſhould be meat of good concoction, and eaſie digeſtion, and no ways apt to generate melancholy hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, but rather ſuch as may hinder the increaſe of them. The meat therefore ſhould be moiſtning and heating in melancholy, and if an aduſt humour be mixed therewith, it ſhould be ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what cooling, yet ſo, that it may not be deſtitute or power and and force to attenuate that which is thick; the meats alſo mixed with Burrage, Bugloſs, Fennel, Parſly, Capers, Cinamon, Saffron, and ſuch like. Meats affording thick and viſcous juices muſt wholly be refrained. If a Quartan ariſe of it ſelf without any preceding diſeaſe, at firſt a little thinner diet is proper, then diet ſomwhat thicker is to be uſed, and at laſt towards the height, a little thinner is to be again adminiſtred: But if a Quartan ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed another diſeaſe, at firſt diet a little thicker is to be taken, and afterwards by degrees towards the height, ſomwhat to be detract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from that: And in caſe the ſick will endure it, let him faſt that day his fit cometh, or at leaſt ſix hours before the paroxiſm, let him eat nothing, according to <hi>Hypocrat.</hi> 1. <hi>Aphor.</hi> 11. and 19. For meats then given, afford not any nouriſhment to the body, but to the diſeaſe: And many Quartans, as alſo Terti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans are prolonged, not by their own nature, but by errors in diet, eſpecially becauſe the ſick either in the fit, or newly before it comes, do not abſtain from meat and drink.</p>
                     <p>Their drink ſhould be white wine, thin, mature, and not au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtere, or Beer that hath worked well, and is not flatulent; and the wine and beer may be mixed with herbs good againſt the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy humour above-named.</p>

                     <p>BEſides theſe ſimple Fevers hitherto mentioned,
<note place="margin">Fevers compound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</note> there are yet Compound Fevers, which is, when one Fever is complicate with another. They are divided into confuſed and expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite.</p>
                     <p>They are commonly called confuſed,
<note place="margin">Confuſed</note> when two Fevers begin and end at the ſame time, ſo that they can ſcarcely be diſcerned; namely, when ſeveral humours confuſed amongſt themſelves, pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trifie in the ſame place, and each or every of them preſerves its own proper nature; which nevertheleſs how it might be done, ſcarce ſeems poſſible:
<note place="margin">Implicite</note> But implicite are thoſe that are ſo joyned together, as that the nature and ſymptomes of either of them ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verally and peculiarly may be known.</p>
                     <p>That complication happens many ways; for firſt, a non-putred is joyned with a putred, as a hectick with a putred; moreover a putred with a putred, and that ſeveral ways; for firſt, continued are mixed with continued, and intermittent with intermittent; and that either of the ſame ſort, whence there are double Terti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, double and treble Quartans; or different, but that is rarer, as a Tertian intermitting with a Quotidian intermitting, and a Tertian intermitting with a Quartan intermitting, continued Tertians with intermitting, when a Tertian intermitting with continued Quotidian, or an intermitting Quotidian with a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued Tertian is mixed, which Fevers are called Semi-Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians.</p>
                     <p>There are three ways of compoſition of Fevers,
<note place="margin">Three ways of compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Fevers.</note> and three dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences of compounded Fevers; Subintrante, Coalternate, and Communicant.</p>
                     <p>Subintrante are, when the fit of the one Fever begins before the termination of the other: Coalternate, when one paroxiſm being-ended, by and by after a ſhort interval, another begins a Communicant are ſuch whereof the paroxiſme of the one doth begin forthwith after the end of the other, there being no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terval.</p>
                     <p>Compound Fevers are known by the ſigns of ſimple Fevers,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:36866:288"/>and principally by the returns of cold tremblings and ſhakings af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter reſt;
<note place="margin">Signs of compound Fevers.</note> and in caſe a cold fit happens, and ſweat do not follow afterwards, or that one ſweat happen after many fits. The pulſe alſo if in a continued Fever it be often contracted, motion of new matter, and of a new paroxiſm, and ſo 'tis a token of a compound Fever.</p>
                     <p>But theſe Fevers are for the moſt part more dangerous then others,
<note place="margin">Progno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticks.</note> ſince that they more afflict the patient then ſimple, and a ſet time for their paroxiſms is for the moſt part wanting, and eſpecially in caſe the compound Fevers conſiſt of ſeveral humours, and they are more difficult to be cured, ſeeing thoſe things that are accommodated to one humour, are not fit for another.</p>
                     <p>But their cure depends on the manner of cure of their ſimples,
<note place="margin">Cure</note> and to every humour and Fever that is kindled, thereby are to be exhibited their oppoſite remedies.</p>
                     <p>But that we may ſay ſomthing of compound Fevers, we will add ſomwhat concerning a double and treble Tertian and Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian, and likewiſe of a Semitertian</p>
                     <p>A double or triple Tertian is cauſed by choler putrifying in two or three places in the meſeraick veins;
<note place="margin">A double Tertian.</note> and indeed, if choler putrifie in two places, a double Tertian is made, which afflicteth either every day once, or in one day twice, that the next day af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the ſick may be free from the fit:
<note place="margin">A treble Tertian.</note> But in caſe it putrifie in three places, a treble Tertian ariſeth, which in the ſpace of two days afflicts thrice, one day once, the other day twice. Nay cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler may putrifie in four or five places, and more, and ſo many, or ſuch Tertians then will enſue.</p>
                     <p>A double Quotidian is cauſed by Flegme putrifying in two places,
<note place="margin">A double Quotidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an.</note> and invadeth the ſick twice in the ſpace of four and twenty hours.</p>
                     <p>A double Quartan is cauſed by a melancholy humour putri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying in two places;
<note place="margin">A double Quartan</note> and thoſe that are troubled therewith, are one day free from a Fever, and the two next are troubled with it. But ſuch as are troubled with a treble Quartan, are Feveriſh eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day; Nay, 'tis not impoſſible but that thoſe that are trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with a compound Quartan, ſhould be affected twice in one day.</p>
                     <p>And indeed a double Tertian is often ſuch from the beginning,
<note place="margin">A treble Quartan</note> but a double or triple Quartan for the moſt part from the untime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly uſe of medicines, eſpecially of hot ſodorifiques, 'tis become ſuch, becauſe the crude matter is only ſtirred up, but not diſcuſſed, but diſperſed over more parts.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Cure</note> A compound Tertian and Quartan is cured as other Tertians
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:36866:288"/>and Quartans are: yet this is to be taken notice of, that the meats or medicines may be uſed at fit times in regard of the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roxiſme.</p>
                     <p>As for a Semitertian which by the Greeks is called a Semiter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian fire, 'tis compounded of a Tertian and a Quotidian,
<note place="margin">Semiterti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an.</note> the one continued, the other intermittent, and indeed principally of an intermitting Tertian, and continued Quotidian, and hath its continuity from Flegm, its hoirour from intermitting, as commonly 'tis taught; whence theſe are alſo called horrid Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers. But although I ſhould not deny that humours putrifie to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in the vena cava, and the meſeraick veins, and that from thence there may ariſe complicate Fevers, which have various exacerbations and mutations in their ſymptomes; yet it ſeems not abſurd to call thoſe Fevers alſo Semitertians, which by their nature are indeed intermitting Tertians, yet when 'tis joyned with an inflammation of any Intral, a ſymptomatical continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Fever is ſtirred up; for when the Feveriſh part of the matter is thruſt out with the blood into the Guts, Stomack, Liver, and parts adjacent, an inflammation is cauſed, and thence a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued ſymptomatical Fever, which being complicate with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termitting Tertian, conſtitutes a Semitertian, which in reſpect of the intermitting Fever is horrid, in regard of the ſympto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical continued. That which Phyſitians obſervations teach us, by whom 'tis found out, by the diſſected bodies of ſuch as have died in Semitertians, that there are inflammations about the hollow parts of the Liver, as alſo in the Stomack, Guts, Meſentery, Kell or Cawl, Spleen; Whence 'tis eaſie to give a reaſon of a trembling or ſhaking fit in this Fever; for it happens ſomtimes ordinately, according to the nature of the intermit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Fever; ſomtimes inordinately, when the inflammation ſeizeth on ſome new part, or when quitture or purulent matter is made; according to <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> 2. <hi>Aphoriſm.</hi> 4.7. Som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times malignity happens to be joyned with theſe Fevers, and then for the moſt part they are popular, and there are many affected therewith.</p>
                     <p>This Fever is known,
<note place="margin">Signs:</note> and if it be according as it is common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſcribed, compounded of a continued Quotidian, and an intermitting Tertian, by the ſigns of each Fever; for a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued Fever on the one humour, daylie brings a paroxiſm, but the other every third day, and ſo in one day there will be two fits, in the other but one. See <hi>Galen.</hi> 2. <hi>de diff. Febr. cap.</hi> 7. But if it proceed from an inflammation of any Intral adjoyned, ſigns of an inflammation are preſent, and together therewith
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:36866:289"/>the intermittent Fever keeps it likeneſs; malignity, if it be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
<note place="margin">Progne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticks.</note> is known by its ſigns.</p>
                     <p>This Fever is altogether dangerous, both in regard of its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuity, and of its ſymptomes, as alſo of its inflammation or malignity.</p>
                     <p>The cure thereof depends either on the cure of an intermitting Tertian,
<note place="margin">Cure.</note> or a continued Quotidian, or on the cure of a ſingle or double intermitting Fever, and of an inflammation of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trals.</p>

<note place="margin">A Hectick Fever.</note> and conſequently the firſt ſort of Fevers, whoſe heat ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to inclination, diſpoſition, or habitude, is in the living parts of the body; It ſtill remains that we ſpeak of Hecticks, wherein the Feveriſh diſtemper becomes as it were habitual, and ſo poſſeſſeth the living parts of the body, that although it be foſtered by no cauſe, yet neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs it can ſubſiſt without it.</p>
                     <p>There are two things neceſſary for the generation of this Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
<note place="margin">Cauſes</note> aptneſs of the ſubject to receive and entertain preternatural heat, and a continual and vehement action of cauſes heating and introducing Fevers. An apt habit of body to take this Fever, is a hot and dry body, whether it be natural, or from what cauſe ſoever it proceed.</p>
                     <p>Theſe Fevers are generated two ways;
<note place="margin">Manner of generation.</note> for either they follow other Fevers, whether burning or laſting, when their heat is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement; or being durable, it poſſeſſeth all the parts, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumes their moiſture; or they ariſe from themſelves, and from evident cauſes, which if they are weaker or lighter, they produce Ephemeraes; if ſtronger, they bring forth Hecticks.</p>
                     <p>But there are certain degrees of a Hectick Fever: The firſt is,
<note place="margin">Differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</note> when the rorid humidity is dried. The ſecond, when the fleſhy and fatty ſubſtance periſheth. The third is, when the heat like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe invadeth the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

                     <p>A Hectick Fever is known by its continual heat, cauſing no pain,
<note place="margin">Diagno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick ſigns.</note> as being equal; and Hectick which indeed at the firſt touch is weak, afterwards it appears ſharper: It is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived more in the Arteries then the other parts: And moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, the heat after taking food, within an hour or two is increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and the Pulſe either is changed, as to greatneſs or ſwiftneſs, yet ſo, that its aſcending appears ſtrong and free, and none of thoſe things precede which forego the fits of putred Fevers moſt commonly; and this mutation of pulſe and heat, endures until the aliment be diſtributed. The pulſe alſo in this Fever is lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,
<note place="margin">Signs of differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</note> frequent, and moderately ſwift; and by how much the more the ſtrength receiveth this Fever, by ſo much the more the body is conſumed, and the ſtrength debilitated, ſo that the ſick can ſcarce lift up the eye-lids, and together with it in the ſecond place, fatneſs in Urine ſwims like cobwebs. Laſtly, The ſame things which appear in an hippocratical face, as 'tis deſcribed by <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> are alſo diſcerned in a maraſmodes or Hectick, with waſting.</p>
                     <p>A Hectick with a Putred,
<note place="margin">Signs of a Hectick with a Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred.</note> and an Intermittent conjunct, is known from hence; That the fit declining, the heat nevertheleſs, although remiſs, ſome is left thereof, and there is great languiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the ſtrength, and all the other parts are more temperate, only the parts where the arteries are become hotter, and the pulſe loſeth not its ſwiftneſs and frequency, and the ſick takes food, but is not ſtrengthned thereby. A Hectick joyned with a continued putrid Fever, is difficult to be known; yet it may be known from hence, namely, becauſe the dry calidity remains after the end of the declination, or of the whole Fever, or its periods; and the body is more extenuated then otherwiſe it uſeth to be, the Urine alſo becomes oylie, as may appear.</p>
                     <p>It is hard to know a Hectick in the beginning of it;
<note place="margin">Progno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticks.</note> 'tis not ſo difficult to cure at the firſt: but that which is neerer to waſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or a conſumption, is eaſily known, but hardly cured, and at the laſt it becomes plainly incurable.</p>

                     <p>LAſtly concerning the cure:
<note place="margin">Indicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Cure.</note> The hot and dry diſtemper in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicates cooling and moiſtning, the ſtrength requires pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, and whatſoever of the humid and ſolid parts is conſumed and dried, is to be reſtored with moiſtning things; and indeed moiſtning things are more ſafe; but in giving cool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing things we muſt be cautious, leſt that the native heat already being weak, ſhould by that means be extinguiſhed. But if a Hectick Fever have a Putred one joyned therewith, the Hectick cannot be cured, unleſs the other Fever be firſt taken away.</p>
                     <p>Medicines cooling and moiſtning are, Violets, Burrage,
<note place="margin">Medicines</note> Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gloſs, Waterlillies, Roſes, Endive, Succory, Mallows the four greater cold ſeeds, Poppy. Out of which ſeveral medicines for preſent uſe may be prepared.</p>
                     <p>Externally, A Bath of fair water may be uſed moſt profitably,
<note place="margin">External things,</note> of which <hi>Galen</hi> 10. <hi>Meth. Medend. cap.</hi> 10. Which that it may moiſten the more, Mallows, Violets, Bearsbreech may be added: 'tis convenient alſo to uſe a Bath of warm milk. After the Bath, let the body be anointed, but principally the ſpine of the back, with oyl of Violets, ſweet Almonds, Water lillies, Roſes; Cool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and moiſtning medicines may be alſo applyed both to the Breaſt and Liver, as alſo to the Reins.</p>
                     <p>But the greateſt hope of cure conſiſteth in Diet:
<note place="margin">Diet.</note> The Ayr ſhould be temperate, or moderately cold: Meats ſhould be cool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and moiſtning, eaſie of concoction, and of good juice, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in them few excrements, and ſuch as is not preſently diſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. In the firſt place Milk is profitable, which as <hi>Galen</hi> 4. <hi>de Simp. Medic. Facult. cap.</hi> 17. teacheth, 'tis cold and moiſt, ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie of concoction, of the beſt nouriſhment, and hath great pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of moiſtning and refreſhing the ſubſtance of our bodies; Which leſt it ſhould be coagulated in the ſtomack, ſome Sugar or Salt ſhould be mixed therewith; and it ſhould only be taken in ſuch a quantity as may well be concocted by the ſtomack. Strengthning and Reſtorative Broths are alſo profitable, of which 'tis ſpoken elſe-where, as alſo food of Almonds, Pine, and Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtack nuts, the four greater cold ſeeds, and of white Poppy.</p>
                     <p>But meats in ſuch as are ſick in Hecticks, ſhould be given in ſmall quantity, but often, by reaſon of the imbecility of their ſtrength. Their drink in our Countries ſhould be Ale or
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:36866:291"/>Beer, or Water and Wine, white and ſweet. Their ſleep ſhould be ſomwhat longer. If a Putred be joyned with a Hectick, we muſt endeavour that the Putred Fever may be firſt taken away, yet the Hectick not to be neglected, leſt that whilſt we uſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies only for the Putred Fever, the Hectick may be encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; if we uſe means only to cure the Hectick, the Putred may be increaſed.</p>

<note place="margin">What the Plague is.</note> although not alwaies, yet moſt commonly a Fever is joyned; That name is moſt noted to be attributed to the moſt pernitious and deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive of all others: But what the nature of that diſeaſe is, amongſt Authors is much controverted. For firſt of all, ſithence various and ſeveral kinds of diſeaſes and ſymptomes may appear in the Plague: Yet becauſe they are alſo often perceived without the plague, the nature of the plague is not to be placed in ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny diſeaſes and ſymptomes differing in ſpecie, but in ſome pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar ſort: Nor doth the being epidemical or contagious, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute the nature of the peſtilence, ſince other diſeaſes alſo may be univerſal and contagious.</p>
                     <p>But ſince that this is granted by all,
<note place="margin">The plague a diſeaſe of the heart</note> that the Plague ſpreads moſt, when many are infected together with the ſame diſeaſe, and they die, and others are infected: Hence it may eaſily ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, that the plague is primarily a diſeaſe of that part on the which life depends chiefly, and the which being hurt, a man is in very great danger of his life, namely the heart, the fountain of life, and ſtore-houſe of vital heat: For although the humour wherein the venome inhereth may ſubſiſt in divers parts (whence the ſame diſeaſes and ſymptomes in every peſtilence are not the ſame to appearance) yet in what place ſoever it ſubſiſteth, it hath
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:36866:292"/>a peculiar antipathy with the heart, and thereby deſtroyeth a man ſo ſuddenly.</p>
                     <p>But from whence that force and quality ſo miſchievous and inimicous to the heart,
<note place="margin">Whether the nature of the plague con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt in pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trifaction.</note> hath its original, and dependeth, of that there is a very great controverſie amongſt Phyſitians; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, ſome do conceive that the Peſtilence only conſiſteth of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trifaction, and conclude, that by putrifaction the nature of the Peſtilence may be conſumed. But becauſe they themſelves ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge that all putred Fevers are not peſtilential, they ſtrive variouſly to determine it in putrifaction, and that they divers ways ſtrive to explain, but all in vain. Whatſoever therefore putrifaction is concluded to be, it ſufficeth not to conſtitute the peſtilence; for there are meaſures and degrees of putrifaction al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo whatſoever they are, ſince that they differ only according to <hi>magis</hi> and <hi>minus,</hi> they differ not in their kind, neither do they ſeparate the plague from the reſt of the putred Fevers. Moreover the Plague hurteth in another kind then a putred Fever doth; for it ſpreads it ſelf for the moſt part in a moment, and brings forth pernicious effects, it diffuſeth it ſelf in an aſtoniſhing man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and into whatſoever it enters, a very little of the peſtilent venome may lie hidden any where a long time, and remain whole, and afterwards be taken into the body, and on a ſudden produce ſuch grievous ſymptomes, and brings forth ſuch effects as are not in the power of the primary qualities, on which the ground of putrifaction depends: Moreover, if the plague ſhould pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from putrifaction only, a Fever alſo would never be without the peſtilence: yet ſince it is obſerved that a Fever is without the plague, as out of <hi>Hippocrates</hi> 3. <hi>epid. comm.</hi> 4.25.55. <hi>Galen de ſimp. med. facult. de terra Armenia. Jac. de partib. in</hi> 1. <hi>quarti Avicen. cap. de Febre Pestilent. Alex. Benedicto, Fr. Valleriola loc. comm. lib.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 18. and out of others it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt. Laſtly, the way of cure is far different from that of other putred Fevers, and the peſtilent poyſon indicates and requires a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexipharmall means, which in other putred Fevers are neither indicated nor have any place.</p>
                     <p>Therefore we have determined that the plague doth conſiſt in a hidden quality, and in its nature wholly adverſe to the heart, and that the peſtilential poyſon is endued with ſuch a quality, which by the effects of it, as we lately ſaid, beyond the primary qualities doth prove.</p>
                     <p>Contagion is joyned with the peſtilence, and peſtilential poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons have always contagion joyned with them as a proper acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, becauſe it belongs to all plagues, but not only to the plague.</p>
                     <pb n="77" facs="tcp:36866:292"/>
                     <p>Therefore we define the peſtilence to be a venomous diſeaſe of the heart, from venomous matter,
<note place="margin">Definition of it.</note> and in its whole ſubſtance pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarly adverſe to the heart, and gotten by infection, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is of it ſelf infectious, and ſuddenly and joyntly hurting all the actions of the heart, very acute, deadly, introducing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive ſymptomes of all ſorts.</p>
                     <p>But what the ſpecifique nature of this venome is, and what its differences are in divers conſtitutions peſtilential, no man can eaſily explain. To me it ſeems probable to be the higheſt degree of corruption, which indeed the humours in our bodies can poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly receive; to which through many alterations, mutations, and fermentations it comes, and into which diſeaſes which went before, at length degenerate: Whence it comes to paſs, that when the Plague reigns, other ſporadick diſeaſes that come not by or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary means, and all benigne diſeaſes for the moſt part are ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, and thoſe epidemical diſeaſes that reigned before ceaſe.</p>

                     <p>COncerning the cauſes of the Peſtilence,
<note place="margin">A cauſe</note> or this great corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption, they are twofold; ſome of them generating the Peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, others propagating the ſame, which are comprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed under the name of contagion. In the former rank are Ayr, Stars, courſe of Diet, Poyſons, imagination and terror.</p>
                     <p>For firſt,
<note place="margin">Ayr.</note> Ayr ſomtimes contains in it the ſeeds of the peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, which when by drawing in the ayr by our breath, men draw in that therewith, and ſo the peſtilence is ſtirred up in them, and that when it happens, moſt grievous peſtilential conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are occaſioned, and is far more pernitious then to thoſe to whom the contagion of the plague is only transferred. Ayr be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes peſtilential, when there is in it exceſs of heat and moiſture, which diſpoſe bodies to putrifaction; ſuch a conſtitution of ayr <hi>Hippocrates</hi> deſcribeth 3. <hi>epid. comm.</hi> 3. yet the Plague may be bred alſo without ſuch a conſtitution of ayr, and that very cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption it ſelf is not terminated in the primary qualities; but 'tis neceſſary that certain occult qualities, and that ſomwhat divine, mentioned by <hi>Hippocrates</hi> ſhould concur, but it takes its venenoſity and peſtilential quality firſt from heaven, whilſt that the ayr by a peculiar influence from the ſtars, whether it be ſo diſpoſed in the firſt qualities, that it ſhould putrifie and be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, or in an occult manner alſo it be ſo diſpoſed and affected,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:36866:293"/>that in it poyſonous ſeeds are generated, which in their whole ſubſtance are adverſe to man.</p>
                     <p>To which thing Aſtrologers teach, that <hi>Saturn</hi> doth prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally act his part. Moreover the Ayr may receive its peſtilential ſeeds from the caverns of the earth, whilſt from thence venomous ſteams exhale, being generated in the ayr long pend up before; to which purpoſe Earthquakes much conduce, which move venomous ſteams in that manner, and open ways for their evaporation; ſo out of a cheſt which hath been long ſhut, being opened, the plague cometh forth, as <hi>Julius Capito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linus</hi> hath noted in <hi>Vero:</hi> The ſame may happen in ſtanding pools and lakes, and corrupted waters in Wells.

                     <p>Secondly, although the ſtars by corrupting of the ayr may be the cauſe of the peſtilence whilſt they ſo corrupt it, as that that peſtilence which is contained in it, the ſeeds or ſparks being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to man, they excite the plague in him: yet by it ſelf alſo, by affecting of mans very body, they may cauſe the plague, whilſt either they diſpoſe the ayr ſo, that whether by manifeſt or occult qualities, 'tis rendred not fit for the preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of mankind, but corrupteth the humours therein, ſo that they become of a peſtilential nature; or alſo proximately and immediately by occult influencies, they corrupt mans body, and principally the humours and ſpirits contained therein; concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which thing Aſtrologers are to be adviſed with.
<note place="margin">Common Diet.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Peſtilential venome may be generated from common Diet. That which often happens in a long dearth of proviſion, in Camps and Sieges, where men are compelled to make uſe of corrupt and unwholſome meat, by reaſon whereof ill humours are generated; which being detained in the body, are more corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted, and at length become peſtilential; as Hiſtories ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly teſtifie.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly Unguents and venomous powders being ſpread a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad may cauſe the plague,

                     <p>Fifthly, The cauſe is imagination, terror, and fear; and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience hath taught us, that ſome whilſt they have beheld thoſe that were infected with the plague, or dead of it, or ſeeing ſome go out of a houſe that was then infected, by reaſon of too much

                     <p>ANd theſe are the cauſes, by means whereof the peſtilent poyſon may be generated in the ayr, or in mans body; yet it often comes to paſs, that neither the ayr, nor evil diet, nor any of the reſt of theſe cauſes have ſtirred up the peſtilence, but otherwiſe from elſewhere being brought into ſome place by contagion, and afterwards by contagion alſo it is diffuſed into more places.
<note place="margin">Infection.</note> For although there are other diſeaſes contagious alſo, yet the plague is the moſt infectious of all others.</p>
                     <p>Contagion is a production of the like diſeaſed or ſickly affect in another body, by pollution ſent out from a diſcaſed body, but there are three things required to perfect contagion: A contagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous body it ſelf that may infect others, a diſeaſe or an affect con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to nature, which is communicated to another, and the body which is infected.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, a contagious body is that which whilſt 'tis ſick of any diſeaſe, diffuſeth not the diſeaſe it ſelf (for the actident goes not out of the ſubject) but ſome of the morbifique cauſe out of it ſelf, and communicates it to another, and ſo in this manner excites the ſame diſeaſe in it. For that which is communicated to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other from out of a contagious body, is not the diſeaſe it ſelf, but a certain body flying out of the diſeaſed body, and received into another, having power of ſtirring up the ſame in it. The Greeks call it <hi>Noſeras apocriſcis,</hi> and <hi>aporroias,</hi> and <hi>miaſmata:</hi> The Latines, the pollutions and ſeeds of contagion; and ſince that we ſee that ſuch ſeeds have not only hurtful qualities in the ſmalleſt quantities, and that they eaſily inſinuate themſelves into the body, but alſo they endure a long time, and retain their ſtrength entire, and they are moſt exactly mixed, and are ſome way ſpirituous,
<note place="margin">Infection how many ways it is ſpread.</note> and 'tis neceſſary they ſhould ſowe their ſtore of ſtrength by ſome occult quality.</p>
                     <p>But contagion is not ſcattered after one manner, for ſomtimes it goes out by breathing, ſomtimes through the pores of the skin, or in the form of vapours, or of ſweat and filth adhering to the skin, and is communicated to other bodies. And this ſeed go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth out moſt plentifully from an infected body, when the poyſon is too ſtrong for nature, and overcomes it, which happens in thoſe that are dying.</p>
                     <pb n="80" facs="tcp:36866:294"/>
                     <p>The ſeeds of contagion are communicated either by immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate contact, or by ſome medium and vehicle. This vehicle is twofold; ayr, and ſome fewel, as they call it: Ayr, when it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives the ſeeds of contagion from infected bodies, it can carry them to places nigh, yea and ſomtimes more remote places. That hath the nature of fewel in it, which can receive the ſeeds of contagion, and communicate the ſame to another; which kind of bodies are thin and porous, as Flax, Cotton, Feathers, the hairy skins of animals, and garments made of them, feathers al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo of birds, and birds themſelves; and it is found out for a truth, that thoſe peſtilential ſparks have often lain hid in the cinders or aſhes; and it may come to paſs, that any one may carry the ſparks of it about him in his garments, and not be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, and yet they being moved and ſhaked, may infect an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other.</p>
                     <p>But the ſeed of a contagious peſtilence when 'tis received into a body, it brings in that diſpoſition with it wherewith that body from out of which it came was afflicted, and that for the moſt part ſuddenly, yet ſomtimes it is found to lie hid ſome days in the body before it denudates it ſelf.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Concerning the body that receives the peſtilent treaſury, although no man can promiſe to himſelf immunity from the peſtilent venome, yet it is certain ſome are more eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſome more hardly infected. The cauſe whereof without all doubt conſiſteth in ſome peculiar occult quality of the heart, by the power whereof it hath or hath not ſtrength to reſiſt the veno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous peſtilence; yet becauſe the venomous quality is not tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred without a ſubject out of the infected body into another, it will more powerfully inſinuate it ſelf if it be received into a body proportionable and like unto that wherein it was generated: whence kinſmen are ſooner affected then others. Yet there are alſo other things that occaſion the more facile reception of the peſtilence; for ſuch as breath ſtronger, and ſuch as have wide and open pores of their bodies, eaſier take in the ſeeds of the plague, inhering in the Ayr, or any place apt to retain it.</p>

                     <p>MOreover concerning the ſigns,
<note place="margin">Diagno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick ſigns</note> that I may ſay nothing of approaching ſigns, deſiring brevity, but only by what means it may be known we will ſpeak. Indeed the plague when many have been infected, may eaſily be known; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore many have been overſpread thereby, there is ſcarce any path<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ognomick ſigne by which it can certainly be known, that one or a few being affected are ſick of the plague; afterwards when more are viſited, it is not ſo difficult to be known, eſpecially when all ſporadick diſeaſes for the moſt part are ſilent: For firſt, the plague ſeizeth on many, and the moſt it kills. Secondly, 'Tis contagious, and eaſily given to others, and 'tis more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious then any other diſeaſe. Thirdly, by its violence it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroys the ſtrength, and principally the vital ſpirits. Whence fourthly, when little, frequent, and unequal pulſes are made, palpitation of the heart happens, lipothymie, ſyncope, and great anguiſh and perplexity altogether. Fifthly, If the diſeaſe be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted, and the venome corrupt the humours, evils and ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptomes happen of all kinds, and the whole order of the body is diſturbed; Fevers happen, divers wheals or puſtules, buboes, carbuncles; yet if there are no puſhes, bubo, or carbuncle ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, we muſt not therefore conclude that the ſick hath not the plague; for it often happens that before they come out, and can be drived out by reaſon of the debility of nature, the ſick die with the violence of the diſeaſe. There happens likewiſe other ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptomes of all ſorts; for when the ſtrength of the body is debili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated by the vehemency of the poyſon, the humours and ſpirits are corrupted, the excrements are changed, and the urine either becomes crude, or fully corrupted, the ſweats are ſtinking and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timely, filthy, foetid, ill coloured excrements proceed from the belly, the qualities of the body are variouſly changed, and there is nothing at all in burning and malignant Fevers, which may not appear likewiſe in the peſtilence:
<note place="margin">Progno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticks</note> But there is no diſeaſe at all to which the Aphoriſm of <hi>Hippocrat.</hi> 19. <hi>ſect.</hi> 2. doth more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree: for oftentimes when the plague flatters moſt, it brings un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected death; and on the contrary, thoſe that have ſeemed deſperate, often recover when paſt hope.</p>
                     <p>But there is the more hopes when tumors come forth ſuddenly in a place that is not dangerous, and after their coming forth the
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:36866:295"/>ſymptomes abate, alſo if the wheals are of a good colour, and with remiſſion of ſymptomes; if medicines, meat and drink are not vomited up again, if ſweats come out with lightſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to the ſick, and other ſigns are diſcerned, which uſe to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent in ſalutary Fevers.</p>
                     <p>But the greateſt danger is, when tumors come not enough out, and carbuncles draw near to the heart, or vaniſh again; if gid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs in the head, watchings, a coma, or convulſion fits are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, if the ſick ſhall ſay every thing ſtinketh, if trembling of the heart, fainting of the ſpirits be preſent, if all things are thrown up by vomiting, if the extremities of the body wax cold, if the ſweat be cold, if the excrements are of divers colours, black, and ſtinking, and if the other ill ſymptomes of malignant Fevers be preſent.</p>

<note place="margin">Preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives.</note> then being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to expel it out of the body, we ſhould therefore be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful firſt to prevent it. The way of preſervation (with Gods aſſiſtance, which we ought to ſeek by prayers) conſiſts in two things.</p>
                     <p>The firſt is, That all thoſe cauſes that may occaſion the ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs may be avoided.</p>
                     <p>Furthermore, that the force of thoſe cauſes when they cannot be avoided, may be broken, and our bodies rendred leſs apt to entertain them, and more able to reſiſt them.</p>
                     <p>Firſt therefore if the Plague reign any where, all commerce with the infected is to be avoided, and if any one be certainly infected, he ſhould be ſeparated from the reſt with all his houſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold-ſtuff, indeed for many weeks, and the houſe infected (as hereafter ſhall be ſhewed) cleanſed; and in caſe it be doubtful whether any one be ſick of it or no, 'tis better to be too cautious then careleſs.</p>
                     <p>But if the peſtilence be now ſown in any place, 'tis ſafeſt to remove from thence, according to that common verſe,

                     <p>And that we may begin <hi>a posteriore,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Purging.</note> the body is not to be raſhly weakned with ſtrong medicines; yet if any vitious humour ſhall be in the body, leſt that the force of the Alexipharmacal me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines ſhould be debilitated, or the venomous poyſon ſhould eaſily take root in the body, it is to be purged by little and little with lenitives; to which purpoſe the moſt profitable are pills of Ruffi, ſo called from the authors name, and by cuſtome called Peſtilential pills; out of which alſo is made the Elixir proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatis, oyl of Vitriol being thereunto added: Syrup of Roſes ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutive is alſo profitable, and Rhubarb, Agarick, and medicines compounded with them, which are every where extant. If blood abound, it may be abated by opening of a vein.</p>
                     <p>The Diet ought to be ſuch,
<note place="margin">Diet.</note> whereby vitious humours may not be cumulated; and with meats and drinks moſt principally things good againſt poyſon ſhould be mixed; and alſo, if as it may eaſily happen, any of the vitious humours be cumulated, let them be purged by the ſaid medicines.</p>
                     <p>And foraſmuch as Fontanels take away excrementitious hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours by little and little, and hence take away the proviſion for the plague, they alſo in peſtilential times are profitable.</p>
                     <p>Mediocrity alſo is to be kept in exerciſe and reſt, ſleeping and waking, and the paſſions of the mind, and principally as much as 'tis poſſible, intentive thoughts of the plague, and fear of the ſame is to be ſhaken out of our minds.</p>
                     <p>Beſides theſe, two things more are yet neceſſary for our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation from the plague: Firſt to take heed that none of the peſtilential ſeed be attracted; Furthermore, if that happen, we being ignorant thereof, our bodies ſhould be fortified againſt it.</p>

                     <p>Out of which are various compounds; amongſt which thoſe that excel, and are approved by long uſe, are Mithridate, Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle and Confectio Liberantis, as alſo that antidote which is aſcribed to King <hi>Mithridates,</hi> of which <hi>Pliny lib.</hi> 23. <hi>cap.</hi> 8. as alſo Theriaca Diateſſaron, to which the moderns have added many more, as the Electuary of Saffron, or of an Egg, as 'tis called, Dioſcordium, Tracaſtory, Antidotus Saxonica, Antidotus Guidonis de Cauliaco, Pulvis Caeſaris rubeus, and Gryſeus Electuarium Camphoratum Kigleri, and many more, which the Tracts of divers Authors concerning the peſtilence afford ſuch as are profitable, as well for preſervation from the Plague, as for the cure thereof; ſo that it becomes us to be more ſolicitous about the choice of them, then the ſtore of them here: And amongſt ſo great plenty, 'tis more ſafe nevertheleſs to depend on thoſe that have been approved by long uſe and experience, then ſuch as are newly invented, what colour or pretence ſoever they afford them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.

                     <p>IF in any diſeaſe in the world, certainly in this an exact way of cure is to be uſed,
<note place="margin">Cure.</note> ſince that the ſmalleſt fault being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by any, may become an irreparable damage: But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the right reaſon of Cure depends on indications, and ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the Plague is an occult diſeaſe, and its nature conſiſts in an occult quality, which by its peculiar force is miſchievous to the heart, and is very contagious; but that is introduced by a cauſe endued with the ſame quality; Hence 'tis manifeſt, that that occult quality indicates a medicine alexipharmacal contrary to it, and ſhews that the cauſe in the body, whether taken by breathing in, or contact, or by what means ſoever contracted, ſhould be removed and eradicated; But how that ought to be done, is controverted amongſt Phyſitians.</p>
                     <p>For firſt, ſince that neither Phlebotomy,
<note place="margin">Breathing a Vein.</note> nor Purgation are indicated by the peſtilence, quatenus 'tis the peſtilence, whether they are to be uſed or not is controverted.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, Concerning the opening of a Vein, ſince that it nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cures the diſeaſe, nor takes away the venome, nor the cauſe, 'tis rarely to be uſed, and in that Peſtilence which is occaſioned by evil Diet, 'tis wholly to be omitted, as alſo in that which ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth from a peſtilential conſtitution of Ayr, unleſs there be very
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:36866:297"/>great ſtore of blood which muſt be diminiſhed, and its heat mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigated: But if the Plague come by infection, and there be that plenty of blood as may cauſe us to fear leſt that a putred Fever ſhould happen, which may become no leſs dangerous to the ſick then the Plague it ſelf, or that it be obſerved that the blood flows violently to inconvenient places, and that the ſtrength is rather oppreſſed by its plenty, then diſſipated, you may breath a Vein, yet only bleed what the ſtrength can well bear with; and that ſhould be in the beginning, for when twelve hours or more are paſſed away, 'tis ſafer to omit bleeding, becauſe the ſtrength be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing debilitated with the violence of the poyſon, it cannot well bear it. Concerning the place for breathing of a Vein, ſuch a place is to be choſen, as may help the motion of Nature, not hinder it, and may together divert the peſtilent matter from a noble part; Therefore if a Parotis break out behind the ears, or a Bubo under the Arm-pits, or a Carbuncle in the ſuperiour parts, a Vein ſhould be opened in the Arm on the ſame ſide; but if a Bubo come in the Groyn, a Vein ſhould be opened in the foot on the ſame ſide. But if a Carbuncle ſhould ariſe in either of the Legs, ſeeing that uſeth to cauſe an inflammation, and great pain, by which the ſtrength is weakned, 'tis convenient to open a Vein in the contrary leg; for neither is the motion of nature hindred by this means, but the matter is drawn from the ſuperiour parts towards the inferiour, and a great flux to the part affected, and the increaſe of the inflammation is hereby pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented.</p>
                     <p>Moreover Purgation alſo is not indicated by the peſtilence,
<note place="margin">Purgation.</note> nor can the ſeeds of the Plague be eradicated by any purging medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine, unleſs perhaps a great diſturbance of nature being made, which muſt then be joyned with danger: and for as much as Nature for the moſt part expels the peſtilent venome to the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parts of the body, this motion of Nature by Purgation is hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, and the peſtilent venome is drawn into the internal parts, and is more mixed with the humours, and the motion of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours being ſtirred up, moſt dangerous, nay deadly vomits and ſluxes are occaſioned: And therefore not in purging, but in medicines that reſiſt poyſon, principally, and next under God the hope of health and ſafety is to be placed.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore it will be ſafeſt for any one that ſhall think himſelf to be infected with the Plague,
<note place="margin">Uſe of Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xiphar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micks.</note> having firſt implored the aſſiſtance of almighty God, to fly to thoſe medicines reſiſting venome, mentioned in the fifth chapter before, and to take ſome one ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced and approved medicine; and in caſe it be vomited up
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:36866:297"/>at the firſt, then 'tis beſt to take of it again forthwith; nay, in caſe it be retained, it will not ſuffice to take of it but once, but the Alexipharmacal medicine ſhould be repeated thrice in the ſpace of four and twenty hours, and ſo to continue for two days, until that the force of the poyſon ſhall be broken. The medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine being taken, the ſick ſhould forthwith compoſe themſelves to ſweat, eſpecially the ſecond time after taking, they ſhould keep out the cold Ayr, and if the ſtrength will bear it, they ſhould continue their ſweat for two hours ſpace: The ſick ſhould by no means ſleep, until he hath ſweat twice, and between the ſweats ſhould be refreſhed with Conſerve and Syrup of Roſes, Sorrel, acetoſ. Citri, of Pomgranates, red Gooſeberries, with cordial and odoriferous waters applyed to the Noſtril, and ſprinkled about the Bed-chamber. It ſhall be profitable alſo to take warm bread out of the oven, and fill a hollow part of it with Treacle, and apply it to the Navel, or to the Arm-pits, that it may draw the venome to it; The ſweat being ended, the body ſhould be rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed and dried with clean warm linnen clothes, being careful that no cold ayr be admitted, and the ſheets and coverings of the beds ſhould be changed. After the ſweat, the ſick ſhould be nouriſhed with meats that afford good juice, and eaſie of concoction, yet taken but in a ſmall quantity.</p>
                     <p>When the ſick hath ſweat once, if there be need of opening a vein, let it be done in that manner as is already heretofore ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed: And when the Alexipharmicks have been taken of two days by the ſick, and the body is Cacochymick, or the Plague depend upon ſome internal default of humours, and that great danger of a Fever be to be feared, it will be convenient to admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter a purge, that ſome part of the matter putrifying and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing, the Fever may be abated; ſo that Nature may over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the reſt more eaſily: they ſhould be gentle, as Syrup of Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes ſolutive Tamarinds, Rhubarb, Agarick, Peſtilential Pills, Tryphera Perſica, Syr. Diaſercos.</p>
                     <p>Afterwards if it be not needful to cauſe ſweat (which never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs ought not to be hindred if it come on a critical day) ſuch medicines are to be continued as hinder putrifaction, reſiſt a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant Fever, and extinguiſh the flames in the bowels and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours.</p>
                     <p>And then we muſt be wary how we uſe Treacle, or any of the other hot medicines, without any reſpect of the diſeaſe, nature, age, and other circumſtances; wherefore when the Fever hath ſet upon the body, ſuch things are not to be exhibited, unleſs they are mixed with cold things, or elſe cold things alone may be
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:36866:298"/>given, ſuch as Syrup, acetoſ. Citri, of Sorrel, Pomgranates, red Gooſeberries, rubi Idaei, as alſo Pearl, Coral, precious ſtones, Bezoar.</p>
                     <p>But ſince that Nature for the moſt part uſeth to ſend the moſt venomous part of the matter to the out-parts of the body,
<note place="margin">Cure of Buboes.</note> and occaſions Buboes and Carbuncles: If the venome perfectly, or moſt part of it be driven out into a Bubo, which may be known by the remiſſion of the Fever and Symptomes, we muſt expect ripe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, although not perfectly, as in other tumors, yet it muſt be helped by all means; for if either a Bubo come not enough out, or be encreaſed over-much, and ſtill the Fever and ſymptomes abate not, and the ſick no ways mends, we muſt endeavour that a way may be opened for the letting out the venome.</p>
                     <p>Therefore either veſiccatories muſt be applyed, or the skin muſt be ſcarrified, that the poyſon may freely expire, and the peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent humours fly out; a young chicken alſo, or pigeon, the fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers about the rump being pull'd off, ſhould to the great advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of the ſick be applyed to it, although no inciſion be made, and that ſhould be often repeated; or a dryed Toad being moiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with wine, ſhould be applyed: afterwards we muſt endeavour that the reſt of the matter may be brought to maturity by proper medicines deſcribed every where up and down; into the place opened by Inciſion, convenient digeſtives ſhould be put; and if the inciſion be not made deep enough, and the quitture be ſtill therein detained, the tumour muſt be opened with an Inciſion knife, and the Ulcer mundifyed with proper medicines, and it muſt not be healed up, until all the venome be come out.</p>
                     <p>But Carbuncles are forthwith to be ſcarrified,
<note place="margin">Cure of Carbuncles</note> and that deep enough, that the peſtilent and corrupt humour may come forth, afterwards ſome convenient plaiſter muſt be applyed, ſuch as may be of the ſoot of a chimney, and others, deſcribed up and down in Authors: Some apply the plaiſter de Magnete Arſenicali, 'tis proper to apply a dryed Toad alſo, being firſt powd'red, in wine, to the places adjacent, leſt the venome ſhould return to the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal parts; ſome defenſitive of cooling, drying, and binding things muſt be applyed; ſome make a circle with a Saphire ſtone about the Carbuncle, leſt the poyſon ſhould creep farther, and thereby extinguiſh the ſame; and if the Carbuncle be too much encreaſed, and cauſe great pain, a vein ſhould be opened under the ſame, that ſo the corrupt blood may be evacuated, and to abate the heat, a plaiſter of Houndſtongue is to be applyed.</p>
                     <p>When an Eſcar ſhall be generated, it muſt be taken away with a convenient Unguent, and the Ulcer muſt be mundified and
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:36866:298"/>cured in due manner; but during the whole time of the cure, twice every ſeven days a potion of the temperate medicines that reſiſt venome ſhould be drunk, leſt any of the malignity ſhould remain in the Body.</p>

                     <p>That the peſtilence conſiſts in a certain occult quality meerly adverſe to mankind, and that it is infectious,
<note place="margin">The plague pestilent and mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnant Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, how they differ.</note> and that a Fever is not of the ſame eſſence therewith, but yet commonly accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies it, is already ſhewed: And therefore the Plague it ſelf al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, when it hath a Fever joyned with it, may not without cauſe in ſome meaſure be called a peſtilential Fever: yet other Fevers al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo are called peſtilent without the plague, wherein the corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of humors hath not yet attained that high degree which may conſtitute the nature of venomous peſtilence, yet they contain in them ſomwhat like to that venomous and malignant peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and moreover either are not pernitious, or contagious as the plague, if they are both of them, yet they are leſs deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive then the plague; for the difference of a peſtilential Fever, ſo called in particular, and of the venomous peſtilence (ſince the nature of them both is unknown) betrays it ſelf in this, by the vehemency and contagiouſneſs of it, which is perceived to be leſs, not only in ſporadick Fevers, but in epidemical peſtilenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als, then in the plague it ſelf: But concerning malignant Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, although they by a general name ſignifie truly peſtilentials, yet in particular thoſe are called malignant, wherein there is a leſs degree of corruption then in thoſe that are truly peſtilential, and wherein the humours which kindle the Fever contain in them ſome occult quality tending to venenoſity; whence there is leſs deſtruction and infection, ſomtimes there is none.</p>
                     <p>And that the matter may be handled in few words, if it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear by the ſymptomes in any Fever, that beſides putrefaction there is a lſo ſome occult and maligne quality, and yet but few die thereof, whether they are epidemical Fevers, or ſporadick, or
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:36866:299"/>contagious, or not contagious; this is the firſt degree of corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption, and ſuch a Fever in particular is called malignant; but in caſe many die, and yet others are not infected, or although there be ſome contagion, and ſome deſtruction, and yet neither the contagion nor deſtructive power have attained to the higheſt degree, and many continue well in health, 'tis a peſtilent Fever in particular. Laſtly, if ſo be many which begin to be viſited die, and that moſt every where are infected, and that the contagion be ſpread over remote places, 'tis the plague.</p>

                     <p>But we have already determined that there are no Ephemeraes nor Hecticks peſtilent and malignant, becauſe that in all peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and malignant Fevers, there are manifeſt tokens of corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption or putrefaction of humours, although that malignant and peſtilent humour have likewiſe a manifeſt antipathy with the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, and may ſtir up a dangerous Fever.</p>
                     <p>But all putred peſtilential Fevers are continued, ſince the force of the venomous putrifaction is ſuch, as that it can eaſily diffuſe it ſelf into all the veins and arteries, and may eaſily corrupt the humours.</p>
                     <p>But malignant Fevers in particular ſo called, may alſo be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termittent, as experience ſheweth: Neither is it impoſſible, that even in the firſt paſſages of the body, the putrifying humours may acquire ſome malignity; and ſeeing that in ſuch Fevers the force of the venome is not ſo great, nothing hinders but that Nature may appoint certain excretions at appointed periods.</p>
                     <p>Continued peſtilent and malignant Fevers, are particularly addicted to no ſort of them, but according as putrefaction hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens into this or that ſickly preparation, ſo this or that conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued Fever is ſtirred up, ſomtimes a Synocha, ſomtimes a perio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dick; whence various ſymptomes likewiſe do ariſe, according to the ſickly proviſion.</p>

<note place="margin">The diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences of pestilent and mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnant Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers.</note> ſince that in every ſuch Fever there are found two things, the putrifaction it ſelf, from whence the Fever ariſeth, and malignity; in reſpect of theſe alſo, do the Fevers differ. For ſomtimes equally from putrefaction and malignity, danger is at hand; which Fevers, if the putrifaction and malignity be great, are exceeding dangerous; but if neither the malignancy nor putrefaction be much, the Fevers are not dangerous. Som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times there is more putrifaction, but the malignancy is not much; and then the Fever comes neerer to the nature of other putred Fevers: but ſomtimes the putrifaction is not much, but the malignant quality vehement, and ſuch Fevers ſeem to be milde but they are moſt fraudulent and dangerous.</p>
                     <p>Concerning the nature of Peſtilency and Malignity, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it be occult, yet from its effects we may apprehend a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain variety, whilſt ſomtimes ſpots, ſomtimes Meaſles, ſomtimes wheals come forth; ſomtimes too great ſweats, ſomtimes Catarrhs, Pleuriſies and other evils, according to the antipathy which the venome hath with this or that particular part.</p>

<note place="margin">Cauſe.</note> becauſe their malignancy is leſs then theirs of the peſtilence, and through this, as it were by degrees, we aſcend to the Peſtilence, thoſe which are the cauſes of the Plague, for the moſt part, are the ſame with thoſe of malignant and peſtilent Fevers; but more mild, as prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally ayr, heaven, courſe of diet, and contagion.</p>
                     <p>Namely malignant Fevers in the firſt place do ariſe from a ſickly proviſion of the body; for it ariſeth from meat that is bad, fit for corruption, and very obnoxious to putrifaction, whereof <hi>Galen</hi> may be ſeen, in his book of Meats affording good and bad juice, and the humours may be ſo corrupted in our bodies, as that they become venomous, of which I have ſpoken in the Inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in the ſecond book, part 2. cap. 12.

                     <p>But as to the ſigns of their differences, if both malignity and putrifaction be very much, the ſtrength will be much weakned, and grievous, nay the moſt dangerous ſymptomes appear: If the putrifaction be very great, the malignancy little, the feveriſh ſymptomes which accompany putrifaction are vehement enough, but the ſtrength is not ſo much debilitated. But if the putrifa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction be not great, but the malignant quality vehement, the ſymptomes which accompany the Fever are gentle enough, but the ſtrength is exceedingly weakned.</p>
                     <p>If the humours only are affected, there appear Buboes, Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buncles, Impoſthumes, Spots, Puſhes, and other tokens of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred Fevers, if the ſpirits are much infected, theſe ſignes are wanting, neither is the heat great, the ſtrength ſuddenly lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſheth, and the ſick are troubled with faintings, the pulſes are unequal, weak, and languiſhing, and the Fever it ſelf in one two or three days ſpace is terminated by health or death. Laſtly, if the heart be much infected, great defect of the ſtrength is preſent, and the ſick do not complain of any great heat.</p>
                     <p>As concerning Malignant Fevers;
<note place="margin">Of mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnant.</note> they are very difficult to be known at the firſt, becauſe the malignity often lies hid, and ſhews not it ſelf, unleſs when it take ſtrength; wherefore all ſigns are diligently to be weighed, and if any thing be ſuſpected, it muſt be ſeriouſly pondered; but all the ſigns of a malignant Fever are greater then thoſe of a Fever; and the ſymptomes which appear, are more vehement then thoſe which can proceed from a Fever, namely weakneſs of ſtrength, unquietneſs, more anxiety then the feveriſh heat would occaſion; the pulſe is freqnent, little, weak, or if it ſeem to be natural, other evil ſymptomes are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, the Urine ſomtimes is like unto thoſe who are in health; ſomtimes thin and crude, having in it no ſediment, or in caſe it have any, 'tis more like an excrement then a ſediment; ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times 'tis thick, diſcoloured, troubled, muddy, having a red and troubled ſediment; the heat is more milde then the nature of the
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:36866:300"/>diſeaſe, and ſymptomes ſeem to afford: the face or countenance is much changed from its lively and natural ſtate; and therefore by theſe ſigns peſtilent and malignant fevers may be eaſily known: yet there are other things happen, heavineſs to ſleep, watchings, diliriums, pains of the head, noiſes and deafneſs of the ears, loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or vomiting, flux of the belly, hemorrhodes of the noſe, tumors ariſe behind the ears, under the arm-pits, and about the groin, alſo divers ſpecks, and almoſt no evil which can be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in other perillous Fevers but may here be diſcerned.</p>
                     <p>Concerning the prognoſticks, and firſt of peſtilential Fevers,
<note place="margin">Progno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticks.</note> there is the ſame with them for the moſt part as of the peſtilence; for by how much the more grievous the ſymptomes are, and the ſtrength more debilitated, by ſo much the more danger is por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended; but by how much the milder the ſymptomes are, and the ſtrength firmer, by ſo much is there the more hope of health.</p>
                     <p>There is the ſame reaſon in malignant Fevers for the moſt part, and what is to be hoped concerning the event in every ſuch Fever, is manifeſt out of thoſe things which are ſpoken in the Inſtitutions, Book 3. part 3. chap. 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.</p>

                     <p>COncerning the cure of peſtilent and malignant Fevers,
<note place="margin">Cure.</note> ſince there are two things in theſe Fevers contrary to na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, venome, or malignity, and the Fever; by what means the Fever may be reſiſted, is manifeſt from thoſe things that have been ſaid hitherto concerning Fevers: how malignity alſo may be reſiſted out of thoſe things which are already ſpoken concerning the peſtilence, is plainly ſhewed.</p>
                     <p>The greateſt difficulty here is in this, to which of them we muſt have an eye firſt, and which laſt, and how the malignity may be taken away without increaſing the Fever, and on the contrary, the Fever may be regarded without increaſing the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignity. Which that it may rightly be done, the peſtilent ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nome and malignity, and the putrifaction and Fever are to be conſidered and poiſed together amongſt themſelves, and regard to be taken whence the greateſt danger may ariſe; and in the firſt place look to that, yet ſo, as that the other may not totally be neglected.</p>

                     <p>Wherefore in a peſtilential Fever,
<note place="margin">The Cure of the plague in particular. Sudorificks Bleeding</note> as being that wherein ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignity moſt troubleth, preſently we ſhould fly to Alexipharmicks and Sudorifiques; yet thoſe are to be rather choſen which are the more temperate, ſuch as were formerly propoſed againſt the peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence; afterward if need be, a vein ſhould be opened, and that timely, and ſcarce after the fourth day, before all things ſhall be diſturbed in the body, and the ſtrength be weakned, namely, when blood doth either abound in quantity, ſo that it diſtendeth the veſſels, or it is a burthen to the ſtrength, or is ſtirred by ſome motion, that it may be feared leſt it ſhould be carried to ſome principal part; but if the diſeaſe have made ſome progreſs, and the ſtrength now labours, the breathing of a vein is more ſafely omitted then untimely appointed; but in caſe the ſtrength will not ſuffer a vein to be opened, cupping with ſcarrifying is fit to be uſed to the inferiour parts.</p>
                     <p>But purging at the beginning of theſe Fevers is not conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent,
<note place="margin">Purging.</note> unleſs ſuch as may purge only the firſt ways without any manifeſt agitation of the reſt of the humours; but ſtronger are not convenient, becauſe they ſtir the humours, and mix the venome with them the more, and often cauſe dangerous fluxes of the paunch.</p>
                     <p>If the matter tend upwards,
<note place="margin">Vomits.</note> and there be any nauſeouſneſs, vomit is to be provoked by the weaker ſort of medicines cauſing them.</p>
                     <p>Hence we are to come again to the Alexipharmacal medicines, which notwithſtanding ſhould be ſuch, as that the humours ſhould not thereby be increaſed: Therefore thoſe are to be exhibited that are more temperate, and together do reſiſt putrifaction; ſuch are Sorrel, Citrons, Pomgranates, Cinquefoyl, Tormentil, Hartſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horn, the bone of a Harts heart, Bezoar ſtone, Bolealmenack, Terra Sigillata, and ſuch like, and medicines prepared of theſe, but principally Bezoar water is often to be adminiſtred, as being that which doth forthwith penetrate, which may be ſo tempered, as that it may reſiſt the Fever and putrifaction; and therefore with ſuch medicines, Syrup of Sorrel, Limmon, Pomgranates, Sorrel,
<note place="margin">Veſicato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</note> and young Sorrel, and ſuch like are to be mixed.</p>
                     <p>The matter being diminiſhed, veſiccatories may be applied to the Legs and Wriſts,
<note place="margin">Cure of a malignant Fever in particular. Purging,</note> to the advantage of the ſick, ſince that they draw the venomous matter from the interiour parts to the exteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, without any trouble or weakning of the ſtrength.</p>
                     <p>But if it be a malignant Fever in particular ſo called, and the putrifaction more then the malignity, the firſt paſſages are firſt to be purged, and not only with lenitive Cliſters, but lenitives
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:36866:301"/>alſo are to be given, as Syrup of Roſes ſolutive, Manna, Caſſia, Tamarinds, Agarick, Rhubarb, Tryphera Perſica, eſpecially if the matter ſwell: But we muſt wholly abſtain from the ſtrongeſt, as Scammony, Coloquintida, Turbith, and ſuch like. And indeed, if the putrefaction preſently increaſeth, and a more vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Fever is thereby kindled, and eſpecially if the humours ſwell, preſently that is to be done, and that before the third day.</p>
                     <p>But theſe things in general cannot ſufficiently determine; theſe tracts in particular of theſe Fevers, ſhew the way more clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; for ſuch peſtilent and malignant Fevers are ſomtimes propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated by infection, when it is moſt ſafe that the pollution in what manner ſoever taken, ſhould be expell'd by Sudorifiques and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexipharmicks out of the body, and afterwards, if occaſion do require, to appoint purgation and Phlebotomie; ſomtimes like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe nature it ſelf expells the matter to the circumference of the body, as it uſeth to happen in the Meaſles and ſmall Pox; but then Nature is alſo troubled in her work, and the matter which is thruſt out to the exteriour parts of the body, ought not to be called in again by purging, but 'tis rather to be helped by Sudo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifiques and Alexipharmicks in its work; but ſomtimes the Fever is occaſioned by vitious preparation of the humours, or is che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed thereby, and the peccant matter in the Stomack, near the Midriff and firſt paſſages, manifeſteth it ſelf by vomit, pain, heat, bitterneſs of the mouth, anxiety, and other tokens, which neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily ſhould be avoided by vomit or purgation.</p>
                     <p>The firſt paſſages being opened, and the body evacuated,
<note place="margin">Bleeding.</note> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently the opening of a vein is to be appointed, if it be needful, and that before the fourth day.</p>

<note place="margin">Sudori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficks.</note> if occaſion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, 'tis convenient to uſe ſome Sudorifique, but ſuch as may not increaſe the Fever, ſuch as we have already propoſed; and although ſweat doth not always follow, yet ſuch medicines are to be continued and exhibited daylie, that ſo the body may by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees be apt to ſweat, and that nature at length of its own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, in its own time, may expel peccant humours by ſweats; but the ſtronger Sudorifiques at the firſt, debilitate Natures ſtrength; and ſince the humours in theſe Fevers are not alwaies ſo diſpoſed that they can be diſcuſſed by ſweats, yet the thinner are diſperſed, and the thicker remains behind.
<note place="margin">Altering preparing medicines.</note> Wherefore pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration and alteration of the humours is to be ordered by thoſe medicines which open, and if occaſion require, may cut thoſe humours, and may reſiſt ebullition and putrifaction, extinguiſh
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:36866:302"/>the heat of the Fever, and reſiſt malignity, and may by degrees diſpoſe nature to ſweats; ſuch are Sorrel, Scordium, Carduus Benedictus, Scorzoneca, the ſeed of Citron, Roots of Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentil, Cinquefoyl, juice of Citron, Pomgranates, and Syrups of theſe, Spirit of Vitriol: when the humours are ſufficiently prepared, unleſs Nature expel alone, they are to be evacuated by a convenient paſſage, but then alſo lenitive medicines muſt be uſed, and purgation ſcarce to be ordered before the fourteenth day.</p>
                     <p>If Nature tend to evacuation by urine,
<note place="margin">Cauſing Urine.</note> it is to be helped by an emulſion of the ſeeds of Melons, Citron or Limmon, Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duus benedictus, with the water of Sorrel, Mayden-hair, and ſuch like.</p>

                     <p>Firſt, there happen Feavers wherein puſhes or eminent tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bercles break forth, and ſometimes certain ſpots ſhew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: the Greeks call them <hi>Exanthemata,</hi> and <hi>Ecth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>
                        <hi>Variolae</hi> are puſtules breaking forth in the skin and parts adjacent,
<note place="margin">Definition.</note> with a continued Fever occaſioned by the fervency of the blood, and ſent forth by the expulſive faculty; but <hi>Morbilli</hi> are little red ſpots or tubercles coming out in the skin with a continued Fever, bred by the ebullition of the blood, and ſent out by the expulſive faculty.</p>
                     <p>Of both kinds there are ſome differences; for of <hi>Variolae,</hi> ſome are greater, ſome leſs; ſome white, others yellow, or of ſome other colour; ſome break out forth with, and riſe high, and are ripened and encompaſſed with a red circle, and come forth without any grievous ſymptomes, and are not dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous; others are yellow, come forth ſlowly, and preſently pitch again, and have a livid circle about them, and are dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous.</p>
                     <p>To the <hi>Variolas</hi> belong thoſe puſtules alſo which break out of the body, and are about the bigneſs of Lupines,
<note place="margin">Differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</note> and ſhining like Chriſtal, out of which a certain wateriſh ſubſtance
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:36866:303"/>iſſueth; which ſome therefore call Chryſtals, the Germans call them <hi>Shaffsblattern, oder Bindvocten,</hi> which are leſs dangerous, and without any manifeſt Fever for the moſt part they do appear.</p>
                     <p>Moreover to the <hi>Variolaes</hi> belong thoſe tubercles coming out here and there in places, and are free from quitture, which the Germans call <hi>Steinbocten,</hi> and are for the moſt part the leaſt of all the kinds of <hi>Variol.</hi> and freeſt from danger, which befals children often without a Fever, and are preſently heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; ſo that Infants ſeldome take their beds for them,</p>

Moreover there are other breakings out which ſeem to be referr'd to Poxes, which the Neapolitans call <hi>Roſſoniam</hi> and <hi>Roſſaliam,</hi> as <hi>Johannes Philippus Ingraſtiat</hi> of tumours ſpeaks; by others they are called Purples, and Eruthemata, yet ſome call the red ſpots or Patechii, purples: They are red, and as it were fiery ſpots, becauſe ſcarce worthy to be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led tumours, coming out over all the body, as it were certain ſmall Eryſpelaes at the beginning of the ſickneſs, or on the fourth or fifth day: In the progreſs of the diſeaſe it ſpreads over all the body, as if it were on fire, or as if one were ſick of an univerſal Eryſipelas, which colour, as in the beginning, ſo in the declination, is turned into ſpots, which again on the ſeventh or ninth day vaniſh, falling away from the skin like ſcales of Fiſhes.</p>
                     <p>The ſubject of ſpots and puſhes is the skin,
<note place="margin">Subject.</note> and other parts anſwering to the skin in proportion; for it hath been found in dead bodies, that the ſuperficies of the Intrals, and on their skin without ſide the Pox have been ſetled.</p>
                     <p>Concerning the cauſe of theſe,
<note place="margin">Cauſe.</note> there is difficult and great controverſie amongſt Phyſitians; The Arabicks, and thoſe which follow them, attribute the cauſe of the ſmall Pox and Meaſles to the uncleanneſs of the blood, contracted from the menſtruous blood in the womb, by the Infant which was there nouriſhed with it; for they ſay, that this filth being left in the body, doth lie ſtill, like unto leven, until ſtirred; ſo that
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:36866:303"/>the whole blood, boyls like new wine, and ſo whatſoever is in it of impurity, is ſeperated and ſent to the out-ſide of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; and they therefore ſay ſo, becauſe they obſerved that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt all men at ſome time are troubled with the Pox or Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſles, and thoſe which have had them once or twice, for the moſt part are free from them ever after.</p>
                     <p>Others are againſt this opinion, and ſay, that it proceeds from ſome occult celeſtial cauſe, whoſe impreſſion, children being more infirm, are apter to take, then thoſe that are ſtrong and in years; neither do they think it probable, that Infants are nouriſhed in the womb with unclean blood, or that this impurity can lie hidden ſo long in mans body, ſince 'tis known that not only Infants, but youths, nay ſuch as are well in years, and old men alſo ſome times fall ſick of the ſmall Pox, which formerly have been ſick of Fevers, and troubled with ſcabs, in whom (in caſe any impurity had been in the blood, it ought to have been then taken away.</p>
                     <p>But in regard both opinions contain difficulties in them, and both ſeem to be held up with probable arguments; let us joyn them together; for if the Pox and Meaſles are epidemical and infectious, 'tis not to be denied but that they then ariſe from a certain peculiar malignant diſpoſition of ayr,: Then Infants, as being more tender, ſooner are infected; although it cannot be denied, that from an external cauſe, an infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty lying hidden within, may be brought forth into action, yet if the power of the malignity be greater, thoſe of ripe years may ſomtimes be afflicted: But if the Pox or Meaſles come forth ſcattered here and there, 'tis probable that they proceed from the impurity of the womb, whereby a vitious diſpoſition of the body is contracted by the party in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy eſpecially if there be no fault in the Ayr; for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though an infant in the womb be nouriſhed with the pureſt blood of the mother, yet when it becomes bigger, and want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth more nouriſhment, it cannot be but that it muſt draw ſome of the depraved humours which are cumulated in the womb with it. Whence it is known, that Infants have been born ſick of the ſmall Pox, or had them come forth preſently after they come into the world: Yet 'tis not impoſſible but that from ill Diet the ſame vitiouſneſs may be contracted, as from the menſtruous blood in the womb, and that may hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to thoſe that have had the ſmall Pox twice or thrice, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it may likewiſe happen by reaſon of the firſt pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:36866:304"/>and defilement, of which ſome reliques were left.</p>
                     <p>The ſmall Pox and Meaſles alwaies come forth with a Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver;
<note place="margin">Whether any and what Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver may be joyned with the Small Pox and Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſles.</note> for they are ſtirred up by a certain criſis, and that ebul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lition not only happens to the ſubcutanial veins, but alſo to the greater; whence heat is communicated to the heart, and a Fever is kindled, and that Fever is made a putred Synocha, as may appear by the equal heat, and the matter contained in the Pox; and that which is gentle, often vaniſheth within a few days, neither is it regarded by Infants, nor the ſtanders by; but that which is more vehement, if the diſeaſe be to determine with ſafety, will abate when the Pox comes forth; ſomtimes theſe Fevers become peſtilential, and then many Infants are extinguiſhed.</p>
                     <p>And thus the ſmall Pox and Meaſles are generated from internal cauſes; yet external cauſes likewiſe do often concur, as humours corrupting in this manner, or lying hidden, have force of moving: The firſt is Ayr, by reaſon of the influence of Stars, or cauſes otherwiſe ſo diſpoſed, as that they may cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt the humours in this manner. Moreover contagion, when a certain ſickly effluvium or ſteam from bodies diſeaſed of the ſmall Pox or Meaſles, is communicated to another body, and cauſeth the ſame diſeaſe therein.</p>
                     <p>But of Poxes and puſhes there is certain differences, as hath been ſaid, in ſubſtance, quantity, and quality. According to ſubſtance, ſome conſiſt of this, ſome of that humour; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to quantity, ſome are big and many, others ſmall and few: according to quality, ſome are white, others red, yellow, livid, violet colour, &amp;c. Some come out ſuddenly, others ſlowly; ſome are preſently healed and vaniſh, others continue long; ſome afflict only the external parts of the body, ſome the internal alſo.</p>
                     <p>But when the Pox or Meaſles are coming,
<note place="margin">Diagno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick ſigns.</note> there is preſent pain in the head, eyes, and throat, an itching of the noſtrils, ſneezing, terror in ſleep, fits like epileptical ones, pain on the back, burning and pricking in the skin, difficulty of breathing, a dry cough, trembling of the feet, yawning, retching, pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation of the heart, which actions ſo hurt, proceeds from the ebullition of the blood, and fuliginous vapours ſent from the heart, and diſperſed over all the body. Their Urine is often like unto theirs who are in health, the peccant matter being thruſt out to the extremities of the body; yet ſomtimes 'tis troubled by reaſon of the great ebullition of humours, the he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrhodes
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:36866:304"/>of the Noſe are frequent, tears uſe to fall from the eyes of their own accord, or the eyes ſhew as if they were ready to weep; ſomtimes vomiting happens, the face and eyes are red, the skin rough, the voice hoarſe, and laſtly, a Fever by the ebullition of humours is kindled; If theſe ſigns therefore for the moſt part are preſent, and are encreaſed on the third or fourth day, and certain red ſpots appear in the skin, 'tis a ſign that the Pox or Meaſles are at hand; and this ſuſpition is increaſed if the Pox reign thereabouts. A little afterwards thoſe ſpecks are exalted like grains of Mellet, and afterwards changed into puſtules full of quitture, and are become Pox, or are extended abroad, and ſmall tubercles are made, and the Meaſles are produced.</p>
                     <p>The nature of humours is principally known by the colour,
<note place="margin">Signs of Cauſes, and of the part affected.</note> for if the pox proceed from a cholerick humour mixt with blood, they are more red, and do itch more from Flegm, they are whiter, from melancholy blacker: ſomtimes likewiſe they are of violet colour, green, lead colour, and with greater cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of humours: If they poſſeſs not only the skin, but alſo the internal parts, the Fever is greater, thence comes great difficulty of breathing, ſtraitneſs of the breaſt, a greater cough, pain in the ſtomack and guts moſt vehement.</p>
                     <p>Small Pox and Meaſles are numbred amongſt acute diſeaſes,
<note place="margin">Progno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticks.</note> and are terminated within fourteen days; they come forth commonly about the fourth day, they increaſe till the ſeventh, the height is manifeſt the eleventh, and from thence to the fourteenth is the declination; but the drying of them conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nueth till the twentieth day ſomtimes.</p>
                     <p>The Fever adjoyned, the magnitude of ſymptomes, the manner of the Pox, and the ſtrength or the ſick ſhew the event. For if the Fever and all the other ſymptomes after the coming out of them do abate, if large hemorrhodes of the noſe have preceded, if the puſtules are great, white and red, ſoft eminent, not alike, come forth quickly, and are ſoon ripened, a good event is to be hoped for.</p>
                     <p>On the contrary, the Fever if it be great, and be not mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigated after the coming out of the Pox, and the tubercles are violet colour, green, livid, haad, contiguous, come forth and ripen ſlowly, and the ſymptomes which uſe to be in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant Fevers be more grievous, the ſtrength weaker, they portend danger, and either bring death, or ſome great evils in the eyes, noſe, chops, gullet, lungs, guts, liver, reins, and leave fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy pits and ſcars in the skin.</p>
                     <pb n="102" facs="tcp:36866:305"/>
                     <p>There is in a manner the ſame reaſon of the Meaſles, which the more milde the Fever and ſymptomes are, the leſs danger; but by how much the greater, the more danger is adjoyned with them; they are ſooner diſcerned, neither are they ſo loth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom to the ſight; red ones likewiſe, and thoſe that ſoon ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare are more mild, but thoſe that are green, violet colour, black and come forth ſlowly are worſt.</p>
                     <p>But the worſt is, when the Pox or Meaſles come not throughly out, or do vaniſh again, for then by the matter left within, or returning in, a greater Fever is kindled, ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptomes become greater, and the ſick, for the moſt part, periſh.</p>
                     <p>The chief ſcope of the cure muſt be,
<note place="margin">Indicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Cure.</note> that ſince Nature ſtrives to expel the matter to the remote parts of the body to aſſiſt it: the ſecond is, That the pravity of the matter may be corrected: The third, That the ſtrength may be fortified: And laſtly, To take care that no part of the body receive any detriment.</p>
                     <p>The endeavours of Nature are furthered if the humours are driven out to the circumference of the body, and the impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that may diſturb the matter in its coming forth, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be ſtore of matter, or pravity of it, or obſtruction of the bowels muſt be taken away.</p>
                     <p>But becauſe this evil principally invades Infants,
<note place="margin">Bleeding.</note> breathing of a vein is not neceſſary, ſince their age will not tolerate it, but if it happen in an age that will bear it, and the abundance of blood require evacuation, preſently at the beginning be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the becoming out of them, a vein is to be opened, that nature being eaſed of part of its burthen, may the eaſier expel the remainder.</p>
                     <p>Strong Purges are not to be uſed, leſt nature ſhould be hindred in its endeavour, or a dangerous looſeneſs ſhould be occaſioned; yet if the body be bound, it may be relaxed by a lenitive Medicine or Cliſter, which together allays the heat of the humours, and ſtrengthens the internal parts.</p>
                     <p>Moreover we muſt obſerve whether Nature do its office in expelling;
<note place="margin">Expelling thing.</note> for then there is no need to help it with many me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines, eſpecially heating ones.</p>
                     <p>But if the Pox come out ſlowly, Nature ſhould be helped with expelling Medicines; yet ſuch things ſhould be mixed therewith, as may ſtrengthen the internal parts, mitigate the heat of the humours, and reſiſt malignity.</p>
                     <p>The expelling Medicines are, Roots and Seeds of Fennel,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:36866:305"/>Turnip, Carduus benedictus, Columbine, Limmon, the Roots of white Dittany, Burnet, Maidenhair, Marigold flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, decoction of red Parſnips, Scordium, Scabions, Myrrhe, Figs, Lentiles, and other things that reſiſt malignity.</p>
                     <p>Theſe things cool and reſiſt malignity, Sorrel,
<note place="margin">Cooling things.</note> young Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel, Lettice, Waterlillies, Purcelane, Barley, Tormentil, En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dive, Cichory, Juice of Limmons, Oxyſaucharum, Rob of Currans; In giving of which, regard muſt be had to the malignity and Fever together, and according as need ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, the medicines muſt be choſen or mixed.</p>
                     <p>Medicines of Figs, Lentiles, Lacca, and Tragacanthwere, in uſe amongſt the Arabians, which were likewiſe uſed by lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Phyſitians; yet if the malignity be great, you may ſly to more exquiſite reſiſters of poyſon.</p>
                     <p>But principally we muſt endeavour to beware that the ſick take not the freſh ayr, but be rather placed in a hot place, that the pores of the skin may be kept open, and that nothing may hinder Nature in expelling,</p>
                     <p>And we muſt be careful alſo, that the eyes, noſtrils,
<note place="margin">How the parts are to be defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</note> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal parts may not be hurt; and therefore the Lungs are to be fortified and ſtrengthned with medicines of Poppy, Len<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, Violets, Tragacanth Roſes, the guts with ſtrengthners, and moderate binders, the eyes, and noſe with ſuch like, as their infirmities do ſhew they have need of. The mouth and chops ſhould be waſhed with decoction of Plantane, red Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, flowers of Pomgranates, Prunellas, Syrup of Pomgranates, and ſuch like.</p>
                     <p>Whilſt the wheals are ripening, there will be much itching, but beware of ſcratching, leſt you thereby cauſe ſcars in the skin; if the quitture be white, and the puſtules not too great, 'tis beſt to commit the whole buſineſs to nature; but if they are great, or many of them joyned together, when by their whiteneſs, ſoftneſs, and freeneſs from pain they ſhall appear to be ripe enough, they may be opened with a ſilver or golden needle beſt.</p>
                     <p>Concerning Diet,
<note place="margin">Diet.</note> the ſick by all means muſt be kept from the cold ayr, neither muſt he be kept too hot, leſt it make him faint: The manner of Diet as in other acute Fevers, is to be appointed, namely thin; yet to Infants, if their ſtomacks will bear it, ſome meat may be given, becauſe their bodies are not diaphoretick, and by reaſon of their ſtore of innate heat, cannot ſo well endure faſting: from meats that are ſalt, acrid,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:36866:306"/>flat, which may increaſe an ebullition of humours, we muſt refrain, and thoſe that moderately cool and bind, and allay the heat of the blood, muſt be adminiſtred. Wine at the firſt is not convenient, but rather ſmall Beer, or Barley water; but in the progreſs of the diſeaſe, when the ſymptomes ſlacken, to thoſe that are accuſtomed to it, a little of the ſmalleſt wine may be granted.</p>
                     <p>There ought to be temperate moderation of the other non-naturals likewiſe, watchings and ſleep, the ſick ſhould ſleep moderately: In the beginning of the Pox or Meaſles, there ſhould be gentle frictions of the legs and arms uſed, whereby the humours might be called out to the circumference of the body. 'Tis in uſe to put a red cloth to the bed in the ſight of the ſick, to cauſe motion of humours to the exteriour parts. The Belly ſhould be kept open with a gentle Clyſter, if need require: Laſtly, all vehement perturbations of the mind muſt be avoided, eſpecially anger and fear.</p>

                     </head>
                     <p>MOreover, another ſort of malignant Fever is,
<note place="margin">Patechiae</note> when certain ſpots like the biting of gnats appear in the skin; There are of divers colours, but principally red, called by Authors <hi>Puncticulae, Peticulae,</hi> and <hi>Patechiae,</hi> whence the Fevers are alſo called <hi>Peticulares, Patechiales, Lenticulares.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Theſe ſpots are without all itching, extuberancies, and ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceration, as in Poxes; and theſe ſpots in theſe Fevers appear principally in the back, arms, legs, and breaſts, namely in pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces through which the moſt eminent veins and arteries do paſs, but in the face they do ſeldom appear, becauſe it is alwaies ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious to the external Ayr.</p>
                     <p>Theſe ſpots have their original from the thinner parts of the putred and corrupt humour,
<note place="margin">The cauſe.</note> whence they ſuddenly come out and vaniſh; but although they are made by the expulſive faculty, driving this part of the corrupt humour to the extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities of the body; yet that ſeldom happens critically, becauſe they come out for the moſt part at the beginning, the matter being not as yet concocted, neither is there any notable eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuation of the matter made by them, nor the ſick are not the better for them, but for the moſt part by how much the more plentifully they come forth, by ſo much the greater ſtore of corrupt matter is indicated, which notwithſtanding as is ſaid already, is not ſufficiently evacuated by thoſe ſpots.</p>
                     <p>There are of thoſe ſpots ſeveral differences; for firſt,
<note place="margin">Difference.</note> they differ in colour, ſome are red, ariſing from the more temperate blood putrified; others yellow &amp; green, when choler is putrified; others, Pomgranet colour and black, when melancholy, putrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth. Moreover they differ in quantity, for ſome come out more plentifully, others more ſparingly; ſome are greater, others leſs, according to the quantity and thickneſs of the humour, and ſtrength or weakneſs of nature: ſome come out at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, others in the progreſs of the diſeaſe.</p>
                     <p>This Fever is known by the ſigns of Malignant Fevers in general already ſet down; and when the ſpots joyn together,
<note place="margin">Diagno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick ſigns.</note> they ſhew malignity more plainly.</p>
                     <p>But what event of theſe Fevers may be hoped for, is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:36866:307"/>by the prognoſticks of malignant Fevers in general.
<note place="margin">Progno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticks.</note> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the ſpots themſelves, although it be good that the pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant matter be carried to the extremities of the body, yet by theſe ſpots they cannot ſufficiently be evacuated; therefore al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though if they are plentiful, they ſhew that ſtore of matter is preſent; yet they ſhake it not of, and therefore they portend danger rather then health: Neither is their paucity always good, and although it ſignifie no ſtore of matter, yet it alſo denotes debility of nature: Theſe ſpots (if they lie hidden) are evil ſigns; becauſe they ſhew that the matter which before was coming to the outſide of the body, does now tend inwards, and go to the head, heart, or ſome internal part. Red ſpots are moſt ſafe, yellow and green worſe, and pomgranate colour and black moſt dangerous. Although ſuch as come out at the firſt appear ſymptoma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>cal, yet thoſe that break forth the ſeventh day, or thereabouts, are critical: yet unleſs other good ſigns are preſent, put no confidence in them, becauſe they do not ſufficiently evacuate the matter; but if they come out ſlowly, 'tis evil; for that happens either by reaſon of the thickneſs of the matter, into which if the malignity fall, 'tis not eaſily overcome, or elſe by reaſon of denſity of the skin, which hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth free tranſpiration.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly concerning the cure,
<note place="margin">Cure.</note> thoſe things that are ſpoken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the cure of malignant Fevers, are here alſo convenient, namely, the belly is to be looſned either by Cliſter or lenitive medicine; or if the matter tend upward, and the ſick be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinable to vomit, a Vomit muſt be given.</p>
                     <p>Then if occaſion require,
<note place="margin">Bleeding.</note> a vein is to be opened before the fourth day, or elſe afterwards to be omitted; but whether the ſpots now coming forth do hinder the breathing of a vein, is ſhewed in the <hi>Institutions lib.</hi> 5. <hi>part.</hi> 2. <hi>ſect.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 17.</p>
                     <p>But ſince nature it ſelf ſtrives to protrude the matter we ſee to the extremities of the body, and 'tis profitable in all ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant diſeaſes to drive out the matter from the greater to the leſſer veſſels, and to free the bowels from vitious humours, the endeavours of nature is here to be aſſiſted,
<note place="margin">Sweats</note> and the matter tending to the outmoſt parts of the body, is by it to be eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuated; becauſe that otherwiſe that which is malignant will admit of no concoction.</p>
                     <p>Therefore let the ſick be kept in a place moderately hot, and forthwith ſome Sudorifique medicine, and which alſo may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt malignity given, ſuch as are before propounded for the
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:36866:307"/>plague and malignant Fevers in general, and for the Meaſles and ſmall Pox; yet thoſe are to be ſelected amongſt them that may not increaſe the feveriſh heat; and the Fever and the malignity are to be weighed together, and of that which moſt requires it, regard muſt be taken.</p>
                     <p>Somtimes a looſeneſs happens in this Fever,
<note place="margin">When a looſeneſs comes, what muſt be done.</note> which unleſs it be too great, ſhould not be ſtopped, but the buſineſs ſhould be committed to nature, and in the interim, only with al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering medicines, and ſuch as reſiſt malignity, the morbifique cauſe muſt be reſiſted.</p>
                     <p>Afterwards to fortifie nature, Pearls, Coral, Hartshorn, juice of Pomgranates, Citron, Confectio de Hyacintho, Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kermes, and ſuch like are to be exhibited.</p>
                     <p>Externally likewiſe medicines are to be applied to the region of the heart, and to the pulſes,
<note place="margin">Topical medicines.</note> which draw venome from the heart, and reſiſt malignity, and ſome uſe an unction ex Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draeolo, and niter to relax the skin, and draw out humours.</p>

                     <p>THere was a kind of Fever malignant,
<note place="margin">The En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh ſweat</note> which began in <hi>England</hi> in the year 1486. and thence it took the name of the Engliſh Sweat, and it reigned there about forty years, and killed almoſt an infinite number of Engliſhmen: Hence being ſpread through the Netherlands, Germany, the Low Countries, Holland, Zeland, Brabant in Belgia, Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, Dane, Norway, France, it continued until the year 1530.</p>
                     <p>The ſame Fever was accompanied with Sweats, and was called the Sudatory Fever; for thoſe which were troubled with this Fever, abounded with Sweat, without Bubo, Carbuncle, or puttings forth; the ſweat perpetually and in great abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance coming out, until the diſſolution of the diſeaſe, which hapned within twenty four hours ſpace: Together the ſick languiſhed, deficient in mind, with unquietneſs, troubled at heart, pain in the head, and alſo with palpitation of the heart, and they had a pulſe, thick, frequent, ſwift, and unequal; and the palpitation of the heart accompanied thoſe that eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, oftentimes ſome years, ſomtimes till death.</p>
                     <p>But the cauſe of this diſeaſe was inherent in the moſt ſubtile parts of the blood and ſpirits,
<note place="margin">The cauſe</note> which were together affected, which the ſhortneſs of the diſeaſe argues, and without doubt the blood and ſpirits contracted this malignity from ſome evil diſpoſition of Ayr, and other corruption; whence alſo this diſeaſe in many places in the Low Countries with cloudy ayr, ſuddenly invaded men, and the birds alſo were found dead un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Trees, and 'twas obſerved that they had puſtules under their wings like Vetches or Tares: But what manner of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of the Ayr it was, can ſcarce be explained.</p>

                     <p>But the chief buſineſs of the cure conſiſted in the promotion of ſweat,

                     <p>In occaſioning Sweats, the ſtrength muſt be regarded, which in caſe it be weak, the ſweat muſt ſo be moderated, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it may not be debilitated more, and dejected: for 'tis ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, that by too much cauſing ſweat, and whilſt the ſick be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond their power to ſuffer, are cover'd in their beds, abundance of men have been ſtifled: During ſweating, the ſick ſhould be hindred from ſleep.</p>

                     <p>AMongſt the malignant Fevers,
<note place="margin">Of the Hungari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an diſeaſe.</note> there is alſo a diſeaſe cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Ungarick, becauſe it was firſt known in Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gary in the year 1556. and thence 'tis thought 'twas ſpread almoſt over all Europe, Indeed ſome think the patechial Fever, and the Ungarick Diſeaſe are the ſame; and 'tis true that ſpots often happen in that, but not alwaies is it ſo, and the name of a patechial Fever is extended larger then the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garick diſeaſe; for this is a certain kind of malignant Fever, or if it have ſpots, and is patechial, yet this diſeaſe is bred in Camps by reaſon of evil Diet, whence we think it to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly called the Military diſeaſe, or the Diſeaſe of the Camps, becauſe that not only in former times in Hungary, but elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, it wandred up and down in the Camps hitherto, and thence is diſperſed up and down. But there is a malignant and infectious Fever called <hi>Morbus Ungaricus;</hi> 'tis continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and hath great ſtore of vitious humours about the ſtomack and firſt paſſages joyned therewith.</p>
                     <p>The proximate cauſe of this Fever is putrefaction,
<note place="margin">The cauſes.</note> the cauſes and malignant corruption of the humors in the vena cava. But they are cumulated and corrupted by errors of Diet, and firſt by default of the Ayr, which in <hi>Hungary</hi> is extream thick and in the night filled with clouds, or if they are diſcuſſed, 'tis very thin and in the Summer time moſt hot; and otherwiſe, likewiſe in the Camps 'tis not moſt profitable; becauſe that in them it is moſt common to lie un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the open canopy, and to draw the vapours which come from the ayr and the rain, and when their clothes are wet, cannot change them, and in winter time are often penn'd up in little hot-houſes. Moreover bad diet may be a cauſe of this diſeaſe, wherewith Souldiers (for want of better) are forced to make ſhift with, and thoſe for the moſt part which are accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed to fare better; hence becauſe good chyle cannot be ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated by evil diet, and the errors of the firſt concoction cannot be corrected in the ſecond, many filthy humours are collected within the firſt paſſages, which with the chyle are carried to the Liver, and thence into the veins, and from that evil chyle bad blood is generated, which even voluntarily tends
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:36866:309"/>to corruption and putrifaction, and at length an unprofitable diſpoſition of ayr coming, it doth not only putrifie, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes maligne. Whence not only a putred continued Fever,
<note place="margin">Nature of the Unga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe.</note> but alſo a malignant is ſtirred up, and one that is alſo infecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, which may alſo infect thoſe that have no ill humours in their bodies, whence the ſymptomes do ſomthing differ. And as according to Diet, ſcituation, and other circumſtances, the matter occaſioning a diſeaſe is not alwaies the ſame, ſo there happens differences in the ſymptomes joyned with the Fever. Nay in the Fever it ſelf there ariſeth certain differences in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the peccant humour, whence from ſome ariſe putred Synochas, from others burning cholerick Fevers: But although great ſtore of peccant matter, as hath been ſaid, occaſioned by evil diet, be collected for the moſt part in the ſtomack and firſt paſſages, yet that is not the containing cauſe of the Fever, but only ſymptomatical, ſtirr'd up by the Feveriſh heat, eſpecially in the beginning of the diſeaſe, that it cauſeth pain in the heart, anxiety, burning about the midrif, and vomiting, and increaſeth and cheriſheth the Fever it ſelf.</p>
                     <p>And all other ſymptomes which appear in other malignant Fevers, may here alſo be preſent,
<note place="margin">Diagno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick ſigns:</note> and for the moſt part ſpots and ſpecks appear; but amongſt other things, the pain of the head for the moſt part is exceeding troubleſome; thence this diſeaſe amonſt the vulgar took its name <hi>die hauptcranct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heit.</hi> Moſt that take this diſeaſe from ill diet, do complain of pain in the ſtomack, and under the pointed griſtle, where a certain retention and hardneſs is likewiſe obſerved. There is great thirſt preſently at the beginning, and the tongue dry and rough, a little after they are troubled with deliriums, which are gone again when the matter falls down to the ears, and then deafneſs enſueth.</p>
                     <p>'Tis an acute diſeaſe,
<note place="margin">Progno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticks</note> and is terminated at moſt in about fourteen days commonly, yet in ſome not until twenty days. But what event of this diſeaſe may be hoped for, is manifeſt by what hath been already ſaid concerning malignant Fevers in general; namely, by how much the ſtrength is the greater, and the ſymptomes leſſer, by ſo much is there the more hopes of recovery; on the contrary, by how much the ſymptomes are the greater and more, and the ſtrength weaker, by ſo much the more danger; with ſome when a looſeneſs happens, 'tis a good criſis, but to moſt when the matter aſcends to the head, and thence down to the ears, and deafneſs followeth, 'tis an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of health.</p>

                     <p>But as in other malignant Fevers, ſo likewiſe in this, the curing muſt be performed by taking away what feeds it, and reſiſting the malignant quality, yet the ſymptomes are not to be neglected.</p>
                     <p>And firſt concerning the Fever,
<note place="margin">Purging.</note> and its cauſe in thoſe that have contracted this diſeaſe from ill diet, or in the camps, this thing happens that the vitious humours are not only contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the vena cava, as in other Synochas and burning Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, but there is great ſtore of humours lies hidden in the ſtomack, and about the firſt paſſages, which is known by the antecedent diet, pain in the ſtomack, anxiety, heat about the midrif, and vomiting; for then that matter is forthwith to be evacuated, as being ſuch as doth ſeverally exiſt, ſeparated from the other humours, it will not come to any concoction, but corrupts both meat and medicines being taken, and Sudo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifiques and other medicines which are taken, are carried into the more deſtructive parts of the body, and it increaſeth the Fever.</p>
                     <p>But this may be done by purging,
<note place="margin">Purging</note> amongſt the medicines Agarick is principally commended, then alſo Vomits, by which oftentimes great ſtore of Flegmatick and Cholerick humours, of all kinds are evacuated, which lay hidden about the ſtomack: But for thoſe which took the diſeaſe only by infection, and in whom peccant humours are not collect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the ſtomack by reaſon of ill Diet; there is no need of Vomits or Purgation, but 'tis ſufficient only to evacuate the firſt paſſages by lenitives.</p>
                     <p>When the firſt paſſages ſhall be freed from peccant humours,
<note place="margin">Bleeding</note> forthwith the firſt or ſecond day a vein muſt be opened, if it be neceſſary, and the ſtrength of the ſick will bear it; but in caſe ſome days are ſlipt over, and the ſtrength be weakned, and the party be troubled with vomiting, or have a looſeneſs, the breathing of a vein is to be omitted. The vein ſhould be opened in the arm, or if the party be weak, in the ancle, which likewiſe conveniently refels the matter from the head, and in this diſeaſe is very profitable.</p>
                     <p>Nature being thus eaſed of its burthen,
<note place="margin">Sudori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiques.</note> forthwith Sudo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifiques, and ſuch medicines as reſiſt malignity are to be given, yet they are ſo to be temper'd, as that they may not increaſe the heat of the humours, nor augment the Fever.

                     </p>
                     <p>It ſeized upon men with a twitching and kind of benum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medneſs in the hands and feet, ſomtimes on one ſide, ſomtimes on the other, and ſomtimes on both: Hence a Convulſion invaded men on a ſudden when they were about their daylie employments, and firſt the fingers and toes were troubled, which Convulſion afterwards came to the arms, knees, ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, hips, and indeed the whole body, until the ſick would lie down, and roul up their bodies round like a Ball, or elſe ſtretch out themſelves ſtraight at length: Terrible pains ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied this evil, and great clamours and ſchrietchings did the ſick make; ſome vomited when it firſt took them. This diſeaſe ſomtimes continued ſome days or weeks in the limbs, before it ſeized on the head, although fitting medicines were adminiſtred; which if they were neglected, the head was then preſently troubled, and ſome had Epilepſies, after which fits ſome lay as it were dead ſix or eight hours, others were troubled with drowſineſs, others with giddineſs, which continued till the fourth day, and beyond with ſome, which either blindneſs or deafneſs enſued, or the Palſie: When the fit left them, men were exceeding hungry contrary to nature; afterwards for the moſt part a looſeneſs followed, and in the moſt, the hands and feet ſwell'd or broke out with ſwellings full of wateriſh hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, but ſweat never enſued. This diſeaſe was infectious, and the infection would continue in the body being taken once, ſix, ſeven, or twelve moneths.</p>
                     <p>This diſeaſe had its original from peſtilential thin hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours firſt invading the brain and all the nerves;
<note place="margin">The cauſe</note> but thoſe malignant humours proceeded from bad diet when there was ſcarcity of proviſion.</p>

                     <p>This diſeaſe was grievous, dangerous, and hard to be cured, for ſuch as were ſtricken with an Epilepſie, were ſcarce totally cured at all, but at intervals would have ſome fits, and ſuch as were troubled with deliriums, became ſtupid.

                     <p>The Cure conſiſted in evacuating of the peccant humors, and corroborating of the Nerves. Firſt,

                     <p>This Fever came with heavineſs in ſleep, pain of the head, a dry cough, pain of the breaſts, hoarſeneſs, pain of the ſtomack, difficulty of breathing, which even when the cough ceaſed would continue till the fourteenth day.</p>
